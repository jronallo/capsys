This presentation includes diaries and letters of presidents and of those who witnessed inaugurations, handwritten drafts of inaugural addresses, broadsides, inaugural tickets and programs, prints, photographs, and sheet music. The selections are drawn from the Presidential Papers in the Manuscript Division and from the collections of the Prints and Photographs Division, Rare Book and Special Collections Division, Music Division, and the General Collections of the Library of Congress. Additional material has been included from the photography collections of the Architect of the Capitol, the White House, and the United States Senate Office of the Sergeant at Arms. Some items, from records of early sessions of Congress to early films, that are already online in American Memory have been incorporated. An important component is the collaboration with the Avalon Project at the Yale Law School, which permits the site to offer Yale's online presentations of the inaugural addresses from Presidents Washington to Obama with associated searchable text transcriptions. A key objective of this online presentation is to make accessible to the public, many of the treasures and other important primary source materials held by the Library of Congress as well as by other institutions. The collection has been organized chronologically by presidential inauguration and an effort has been made to offer a balanced number of items for each inaugural event.","id":"4ebd6b963eae5900060003bd","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82125","name":"'I Do Solemnly Swear...': Presidential Inaugurations","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:59Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/pihtml/pihome.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:42Z","id":"4ebddce6aede64000600072b","profile_id":"4ebd6b963eae5900060003bd","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:42Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:18Z","description":"\"Now What a Time\": Blues, Gospel, and the Fort Valley Music Festivals, 1938-1943 consists of approximately one hundred sound recordings, primarily blues and gospel songs, and related documentation from the folk festival at Fort Valley State College (now Fort Valley State University), Fort Valley, Georgia. The documentation was created by John Wesley Work III in 1941 and by Lewis Jones and Willis Laurence James in March, June, and July 1943. Also included are recordings made in Tennessee and Alabama (including six Sacred Harp songs) by John Work between September 1938 and 1941. These recording projects were supported by the Library of Congress's Archive of American Folk Song (now the Archive of Folk Culture, American Folklife Center). Song lists made by the collectors, correspondence with the Archive about the trips, and a special issue of the Fort Valley State College student newsletter, The Peachite: Festival Number, are also included. One interesting feature of this collection is the topical rewording of several standard gospel songs to address the wartime concerns of the performers.

The earthquake's epicenter was located near the city along the San Andreas Fault. Damage from the earthquake was widespread, occurring for hundreds of miles along the extensive fault line. As San Francisco was then the West Coast's most populous city and it's leading economic and cultural center, the repercussions of the earthquake and fire throughout the region were tremendous. Since then, documentation pertaining to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire has been collected and preserved these many years at various libraries and archives throughout the state. In preparation for the 100th anniversary of the disaster, some of these institutions have collaborated in an effort to make selected primary source materials accessible in a digital format.

In particular, it features the damage to the public square, the county courthouse, the Georgia Power Company, the Cooper Pants Factory, and the First Methodist Church. The 1936 Gainesville tornado (part of a massive tornado outbreak across the Deep South that also heavily damaged Tupelo, Mississippi) is generally regarded as the fifth deadliest in U.S. history.

The items include photographic prints, negatives, lantern slides, sketches, documents, and memorabilia from several collections donated by members (or relatives of members) of these medical units. The unit's crest was approved on July 26, 1942. The overall shape of the crest is that of the acacia tree. The maroon background is superimposed with a yellow fleur-de-lis and a silver nightingale. The silver scroll at the base bears the Latin inscription, \"REVIRESCO.\" The acacia tree was selected because the astringent medicine, catechu or cutch, is drawn from this thorny Egyptian tree. Maroon is a color used for the Army Medical Department. The fleur-de-lis represents the unit's service in France, and the nightingale is symbolic of Florence Nightingale's unprecedented medical efforts. \"Reviresco\" means \"I flourish again,\" and is indicative of the unit's prime mission, the rejuvenation of patients. Base Hospital 21 and the 21st General Hospital both served the United States with distinction. Since the Second World War, the unit has been allotted to the Army Reserve Corps and assigned to the Fifth Army under the 102d U.S. Army Reserve Command. The unit was partially activated in 1990 to serve in Desert Shield/Desert Storm. After the inactivation of the 102d ARCOM, the unit was assigned to the 89th Regional Support Command in 1996 under the United States Army Reserve Command. The 21st General Hospital medical staff continues to serve proudly and have been selected to provide support to missions in the Dominican Republic, Panama, Paraguay, Bolivia, Guatemala, Egypt, Italy and Germany. Contingency deployments have been made to Kosovo, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. The unit today is organized as a 500-bed Deployable Medical Systems General Hospital and is the only Army Reserve Medical unit in the St. Louis area. On September 16, 2004, the 21st General Hospital will inactivate and become the 301st Combat Support Hospital. This will close the military history books on the unit, as it has been known for almost 90 years. The record of the meritorious service and outstanding history of Base Hospital 21 and the 21st General Hospital live on, however, in the United States Military Archives and in the archival collections held by the Washington University School of Medicine's Bernard Becker Medical Library.","id":"4ebd6b803eae590006000362","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82016","name":"21st General Hospital/Base 21 Hospital","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:52:38Z","url":"http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/gh21/intro.htm","achievements":{}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:17Z","description":"This digital collection contains diaries and related items of soldiers from Iowa who fought in the American Civil War (1861-1865).

The collection includes many songs from the heyday of antebellum black face minstrelsy in the 1850s and from the abolitionist movement of the same period. Numerous titles are associated with the novel and the play Uncle Tom's Cabin. Civil War period music includes songs about African-American soldiers and the plight of the newly emancipated slave. Post-Civil War music reflects the problems of Reconstruction and the beginnings of urbanization and the northern migration of African Americans. African-American popular composers include James Bland, Ernest Hogan, Bob Cole, James Reese Europe, and Will Marion Cook. Twentieth century titles feature many photographs of African-American musical performers, often in costume. Unlike many other sorts of published works, sheet music can be produced rapidly in response to an event or public interest, and thus is a source of relatively unmediated and unrevised perspectives on quickly changing events and public attitudes. Particularly significant in this collection are the visual depictions of African Americans which provide much information about racial attitudes over the course of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.","id":"4ebd6b853eae590006000371","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82047","name":"African-American Sheet Music, 1850-1920: Selected from the Collections of Brown University","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:51Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/sheetmusic/brown/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:34Z","id":"4ebddcdeaede640006000693","profile_id":"4ebd6b853eae590006000371","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:34Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:57Z","description":"After the Day of Infamy: \"Man-on-the-Street\" Interviews Following the Attack on Pearl Harbor presents approximately twelve hours of opinions recorded in the days and months following the bombing of Pearl Harbor from more than two hundred individuals in cities and towns across the United States.

The phrase \"burnt district\" is used to refer to the more than 140 acres or 80 city blocks of the downtown Baltimore business district reduced to rubble by the great fire of February 7-8, 1904. It took only half an hour for a burning, six-story building to turn into a raging, out of control fire that would wreak devastation, with flames in some areas estimated to have reached temperatures of 2200 to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. Baltimore City officials and the State of Maryland were quick to respond in the aftermath of the fire. The Citizens' Relief Committee (CRC) and BDC were each established by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and put at the disposal of Mayor Robert M. McLane. The CRC was given a fund of $250,000 to disburse for the immediate relief of those individual citizens who had lost property in the fire. Financial aid came in from around the country as well. It is testament to the resilience of Baltimoreans that only a mere $23,000 was spent. The BDC set to work creating and implementing plans to clear away debris and rubble and to clear and widen streets and rebuild and open public spaces. It took three years to do it, but they played a significant role in helping Baltimore get back on its feet to thrive and flourish as a bustling metropolis once more. Not all of Baltimore's buildings were lost in the fire. Fireproofing technologies had been incorporated into a number of historic buildings that still stand today. Although effective at fire resistance, these technologies were not foolproof, and lessons were learned that played a role in shaping some of the standards for the fireproofing of buildings today.","id":"4ebd6bf73eae590006000488","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82457","name":"Aftermath of the Great Baltimore Fire \u2013 Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:52:07Z","url":"http://www.prattlibrary.org/research/digitalcollections.aspx?id=63698","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:12Z","id":"4ebddd40aede6400060008a4","profile_id":"4ebd6bf73eae590006000488","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:12Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Science","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:07Z","description":"AlabamaMosaic is a repository of digital materials on Alabama's history, culture, places, and people.

These drawings were the basis for wood-engraved illustrations in the periodicals published by his employers. In the decades preceding the use of the photographic halftone as the preferred method of reproduction in magazines and newspapers, Waud's keen eye and deft pencil strokes were the means by which many Americans experienced episodes of the Civil War and visualized the cities and towns of mid-America.","id":"4ebd69c93eae590006000194","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81287","name":"Alfred and William Waud Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:59Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_AWW.php?CISOROOT=/AWW","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:06Z","id":"4ebddbd2aede64000600030d","profile_id":"4ebd69c93eae590006000194","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:06Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:37Z","description":"Photographs of historical people and events in the local history of Algonquin and Lake in the Hills, Illinois.","id":"4ebd6bad3eae590006000428","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82345","name":"Algonquin and Lake in the Hills Local History","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:16Z","url":"http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/algonqui001","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:15Z","id":"4ebddd07aede6400060007e4","profile_id":"4ebd6bad3eae590006000428","text":"User-agent: *\r\nAllow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:15Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:24Z","description":"Collection consists of correspondence, photographs, publications, and printed material related to the activities and interests of Alice Greenfield McGrath, including Mexican American causes in Los Angeles.

Not to be confused with sheet music, song sheets are single printed sheets, usually six by eight inches, with lyrics but no music. These were new songs being sung in music halls or new lyrics to familiar songs, like \"Yankee Doodle\" or \"The Last Rose of Summer.\" Some of America's most beloved tunes were printed as song sheets, including \"The Star Spangled Banner\" and \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Song sheets are an early example of a mass medium and today they offer a unique perspective on the political, social, and economic life of the time, especially during the Civil War. Some were dramatic, some were humorous; all of them had America joining together in song. The Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress holds 4291 song sheets. Included among these American songs are ninety-seven British song sheets from Dublin and London. The collection spans the period from the turn of the nineteenth century to the 1880s, although a majority of the song sheets were published during the height of the craze, from the 1850s to the 1870s.","id":"4ebd6b863eae590006000376","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82052","name":"America Singing: Nineteenth-Century Song Sheets","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:51Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amsshtml/amsshome.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:34Z","id":"4ebddcdeaede64000600069d","profile_id":"4ebd6b863eae590006000376","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:34Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:30:35Z","description":"The America at War Collection chronicles the military history of the United States from the 1760s through the Vietnam War.

This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy E. Stryker, formerly an economics instructor at Columbia University, and employed such photographers as Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Russell Lee, Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn, Jack Delano, Marion Post Wolcott, Gordon Parks, John Vachon, and Carl Mydans. The project initially documented cash loans made to individual farmers by the Resettlement Administration and the construction of planned suburban communities. The second stage focused on the lives of sharecroppers in the South and migratory agricultural workers in the midwestern and western states. As the scope of the project expanded, the photographers turned to recording both rural and urban conditions throughout the United States as well as mobilization efforts for World War II.;The collection encompasses the images made by photographers working in Stryker's unit as it existed in a succession of government agencies: the Resettlement Administration (1935-1937), the Farm Security Administration (1937-1942), and the Office of War Information (1942-1944). The collection also includes photographs acquired from other governmental and non-governmental sources, including the News Bureau at the Offices of Emergency Management (OEM), various branches of the military, and industrial corporations. In total, the collection consists of about 164,000 black-and-white film negatives and transparencies, 1,610 color transparencies, and around 107,000 black-and-white photographic prints, most of which were made from the negatives and transparencies. The collection was transferred to the Library of Congress in 1944.","id":"4ebd69183eae5900060000cb","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?70061210","name":"America from the Great Depression to World War II: Color Photographs from the FSA-OWI, 1939-1945","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:13Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/fsachtml/fsowhome.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:53Z","id":"4ebddb4daede640006000193","profile_id":"4ebd69183eae5900060000cb","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:53Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:58Z","description":"The Library's daguerreotype collection consists of more than 725 photographs dating from 1839 to 1864.

All illuminate the manner in which people have joyfully expressed themselves as they dance for and with one another.","id":"4ebd6b863eae590006000378","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82054","name":"American Ballroom Companion: Dance Instruction Manuals, ca. 1490-1920","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:51Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/dihtml/dihome.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:34Z","id":"4ebddcdeaede6400060006a1","profile_id":"4ebd6b863eae590006000378","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:34Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:30Z","description":"Each year students in St. Andrew's AP U.S. History and America in the Twentieth Century classes select an individual of no relation to interview about a particular period or event of the American Century. This project is teaching some of the next generation of Marylanders how to be historians who create a useable sense of the past.  St. Andrew's students have documented first hand accounts of such historical topics as various wars, civil rights, the American Dream, and education. These interviews offer a unique view of some of America's historical events explored by the inquiring minds of Maryland's future generation.\n\nThe American Century Project is a collection of oral histories completed by students at St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, in their junior year of high school. Oral history is an historical method that uses recorded interviews to preserve firsthand memories, accounts, and interpretations of a person's life, an event, a place, a way of life, or period.  Introduced at St. Andrew's Episcopal School by History teacher Glenn Whitman in 1997, the American Century Project trains students to understand the challenges associated with oral history as a historical methodology as well as providing the students a chance to collect and preserve a primary source.","id":"4ebd6a7a3eae5900060002ad","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81662","name":"American Century Project - St. Andrew's Episcopal School","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:50Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=11150","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:28Z","id":"4ebddc9caede640006000532","profile_id":"4ebd6a7a3eae5900060002ad","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:28Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Foreign Languages","Religion","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:58Z","description":"This presentation features selected documents from the American Colony in Jerusalem Collection.

Much of the material was donated by George Lewis, nephew of Edward Gardner Lewis. The collection of brochures and promotional materials provides a look at Mr. Lewis' remarkable talent for targeting markets. Each brochure had a specific audience&emdash;teachers, students, advertisers&emdash;identifying just the benefits that would most appeal to each. The minutes of the Board of Managers of the American Woman's League begin on a positive note, just after the first Convention in 1910. But they soon begin to chronicle the financial difficulties of the League and the struggle to continue to provide the promised benefits. The minutes are often very brief, and too often, the lack of detail raises questions for which we do not have answers. The reports of the various committees at the convention of the American Woman's Republic in 1912 are more positive, and the congratulatory telegrams and letters reflect the support for the Republic and for Mr. Lewis from chapters across the country. The two most significant items in the collection are the Grand Prize certificate awarded to the American Woman's League for pottery at the International Exposition of Industries and Achievement in Turin, Italy in 1911 and the original Declaration of Equal Rights and Constitution of the American Woman's Republic signed by 400 senators, representatives and delegates attending the first convention in 1912. In addition to viewing images of the original documents, two publications, University City and the American Woman's League and The Pioneer of an American Woman's Republic are available as word searchable documents.

In \"Suffering under a Great Injustice\": Ansel Adams's Photographs of Japanese-American Internment at Manzanar, the Prints and Photographs Division at the Library of Congress presents for the first time side-by-side digital scans of both Adams's 242 original negatives and his 209 photographic prints (with the print on the left and the negative on the right), allowing viewers to see his darkroom technique and in particular how he cropped his prints.;Adams's Manzanar work is a departure from his signature style of landscape photography. Although a majority of the photographs are portraits, the images also include views of daily life, agricultural scenes, and sports and leisure activities. When he offered the collection to the Library in 1965, Adams wrote, \"The purpose of my work was to show how these people, suffering under a great injustice, and loss of property, businesses and professions, had overcome the sense of defeat and dispair [sic] by building for themselves a vital community in an arid (but magnificent) environment...All in all, I think this Manzanar Collection is an important historical document, and I trust it can be put to good use.\"","id":"4ebd691c3eae5900060000d5","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?70428621","name":"Ansel Adams's Photographs of Japanese-American Internment at Manzanar","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:13Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/anseladams/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:55Z","id":"4ebddb4faede6400060001a4","profile_id":"4ebd691c3eae5900060000d5","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:55Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:30:38Z","description":"Louisiana's antebellum history is reveled through a variety of artifacts that document a variety of critical topics in American History. Maps from the Louisiana State Museum, The Historic New Orleans Collection and Tulane University Library Special Collections follow the territorial growth of the United States from the Louisiana Purchase through the 1850s. Antebellum New Orleans lifestyles unfold through paintings, newspaper ads and sheet music, such as The Bamboula by Louis Gottschalk. Three-dimensional artifacts, official deeds and bills of sale explain the unique economic and social roles of Free People of Color in Louisiana. Of particular note is The Historic New Orleans Collection's Les Cenelles, a rare book of African-American poetry, probably the first such collection published in the United States, containing poems written by free men of color in New Orleans. These artifacts coupled with samples of French and English newspapers, sheet music from Louisiana's Know Nothing Party, and naturalization certificates attest to New Orleans's social and cultural diversity.\n\nInvoices, newspaper ads, maps and three-dimensional artifacts also indicate the diversity of Louisiana's antebellum economy. Norman's Chart of the Lower Mississippi River documents land ownership along the river while Norman's Plan of New Orleans and Environs reveals how New Orleans dominated river trade. The issue of slavery is traced by newspaper ads, artifacts and records of slave insurrections. Researchers may also examine digital images of uncut bank notes and Louisiana's French \"Dix\" from the antebellum period.","id":"4ebd69ce3eae590006000197","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81290","name":"Antebellum Period Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:00Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_APC.php?CISOROOT=/APC","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:08Z","id":"4ebddbd4aede640006000313","profile_id":"4ebd69ce3eae590006000197","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:08Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:30:46Z","description":"The Anthony J.

Nearly all of this data is in print, that is, on paper. The intention of this work is to bring this vast amount of information together into an electronic publication, interpret and present it in a way that makes it meaningful, and deliver it to the researcher or casual reader in an easily accessible form.\n\nUnlike the world of print publications, a website is organic. It grows and morphs as new material is added and old material is enhanced. For now, this site covers roughly 100 years of growth at UNL, from the University's inception in 1869, through the mid 1960s, a period of unprecedented growth, both in enrollment and physical development.

The online collection provides access to 29,000 negatives and color transparencies. These were copied during a special preservation project in 1991-1993. Covering a time period roughly between 1896 and 1970 with the bulk portion dating 1935 - 1955, the Gottscho-Schleisner collection provides a detailed look at architectural styles and trends throughout the nation from the perspective of the architect as well as the client. The collection is accompanied by logbooks which provide a chronological negative list and an index of clients. Gottscho was commissioned to document work produced by architects, sculptors, and artists as well as several major publications included among his clients were House Beautiful and Home and Garden. Also among his clients were musicians, writers, and the social elite. While not photojournalists, Gottscho and Schleisner's images do serve as a document of social change from a particular vantage point of the middle and upper classes of society. Gottscho's particular interest were the projects and work of landscape architects and the gardens of the major property owners.;The collection also provides a look at nature through the eyes of Samuel Gottscho.

Recruitment was delayed for a year, but by the fall of 1865, the First Arizona Volunteer Infantry of more than 350 men had been issued into service under the command of nine officers. According to the Third Arizona Territorial Legislature, the volunteers inflicted \"greater punishment on the Apaches than all other troops in the territory.\" After their year in service ended, the War Department disbanded the Arizona Volunteers because the army did not have the authority to retain native recruits. The 1st Volunteer Infantry began the lineage of the future \"Bushmasters.\"\n\nAs a result of Pancho Villa and his men crossing the Mexican border and raiding Columbus, New Mexico, General \"Black Jack\" Pershing was ordered to lead a Punitive Expedition to apprehend and capture Villa and his bandits. The President called up the militias of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas on May 9th, 1916. The Arizona militia, the 1st Arizona Infantry, was mustered in by May 19. Three weeks after the passage of the 1916 National Defense Act in late June, the National Guard of all of the states (except Nevada which did not have a militia), and Alaska and the District of Columbia were called into Federal service. There were as many as 111,954 guardsmen along the border at the end of August 1916. Douglas, Arizona, was one of the four assembly points for the guard units. The Arizona National Guard was called into active federal service on 9 May 1916, with Col. Alexander McKenzie Tuthill as regimental commander. Besides being stationed at Naco, there were elements at Ajo, Nogales, Fort Huachuca, Douglas and other border outposts.\n\nArizona's First Infantry Regiment was drafted into Federal Service for World War I, August 5, 1917 as part of the 40th Division. The Regiment was re-designated as the 158th Infantry Regiment on October 3, 1917, and sent overseas in July and August 1918. In France, the 158th Infantry was assigned to a division, which furnished replacement personnel to other units. The 158th Infantry was honored to act as guard of honor to President Wilson during his residence in France in 1918, and the 158th Infantry Band was chosen as Wilson's honor band.\n\nOn 16 September 1940, with the declaration of the National Emergency, the 158th Infantry joined its parent organization, the 45th Division at Ft. Sill, Oklahoma. They trained for five months, moving to Camp Barkley at Abilene, Texas, 28 February 1941. Following the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, the 158th Infantry Regiment was removed from the 45th Division becoming a separate Regiment. January 1942 found the Regiment embarking at the Port of New Orleans and disembarking in the Canal Zone.","id":"4ebd6a1d3eae5900060001fb","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81439","name":"Arizona Bushmasters","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:20Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/ammbush","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:48Z","id":"4ebddc38aede6400060003d6","profile_id":"4ebd6a1d3eae5900060001fb","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:48Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:31:58Z","description":"The Arizona County and Local Publications collection has been contributed by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records' Law and Research Library.

And for over a century, the Arizona Geological Survey and its predecessors have collected and archived information on mines and mine activities in Arizona. The Mines Collection of the Arizona Geological Survey contains information on thousands of Arizona mines -- only a select few are displayed here. All told, the collection comprises more than 82 linear feet of files filled with old newspaper clippings, accounts of mine histories, geologic reports, mineral assessments, production reports, historic letters inquiring of ore reserves and economic viability, and to a lesser extent, maps, geologic cross-sections, assay reports, mine schematics, and photographs. Most of the files were compiled between 1900 and 1960. These files shine a light into individual mines, which, when taken collectively, illuminate the rich and diverse history of mining and miners in Arizona.","id":"4ebd6a543eae590006000265","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81565","name":"Arizona Mines","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:36Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/azgsam","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:54Z","id":"4ebddc7aaede6400060004a4","profile_id":"4ebd6a543eae590006000265","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:54Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:00Z","description":"The Arizona State Agency Publications collection has been contributed by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records' Law and Research Library.

Historians have often downplayed the role of women in the West, denying them individual as well as collective importance. Women from the East were cast in the Victorian role as fragile, dependent, and dainty, unsuited and unwilling to face the hardships of frontier life. Native American women were often romanticized as noble and anonymous princesses. The large number of Hispanic women remained largely invisible in the literature, while Asian- and African American women were non-existent to writers and photographers alike.\n\nResearch on the true place of women in history is ongoing. Careful and open examinations of the lives of a few have already demonstrated that their impact on the settlement, civilization and progress of Arizona was far greater than previously believed. Regardless of race or creed they all held firm in working toward a better life. These women raised children, tended the home and worked in the fields; they also owned mines, flew planes, planned roads and expanded the economic base.\n\nThe women of the West were both saints and shady ladies. They did not and could not fit the Victorian models of womanhood. Those artificial standards were impossible to maintain in the newly settled West. It would be ridiculous to ride twenty miles only to leave a calling card, and many of the other rules of conduct were equally inappropriate. While the spirit of gentility -- care of family, consideration of others, and moral fiber -- was present, the outward appearances could not be kept; therefore, none of these women could truly be considered \"ladies.\" Instead they lived practically and industriously. Famous or \"unsung heroines,\" their lives and works shaped the form and spirit of the state of Arizona.","id":"4ebd6a223eae590006000204","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81448","name":"Arizona's Saints and Shady Ladies","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:21Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/ahfsaints","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:53Z","id":"4ebddc3daede6400060003e8","profile_id":"4ebd6a223eae590006000204","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:53Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:01Z","description":"Federal publications are printed by the authority of Congress or by executive or judicial agencies at taxpayer expense and are distributed to federal agencies, their clientele and to depository libraries which serve the public.

These letters, diaries, and memoirs reveal charming, educated women with a great interest in the world around them, who reported intelligently on political and military matters. Tested by hardship, they felt competent, useful, and superior to women of similar status in eastern cities. They delighted in the favors extended toward an officers' wife, though they chafed under the restrictions imposed on a garrison in contested territory. They were spoiled and tough, independent and subordinate. They created a place for women in the Army that allowed them insider knowledge of military operations and some small degree of influence over military affairs. They were not incidental to the conquest of the Plains, but participants and recorders of a period of significant change in American history.","id":"4ebd6a493eae590006000256","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81533","name":"Army Officers' Wives on the Great Plains, 1865-1900","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:35Z","url":"http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/projects/army_officers_wives/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:47Z","id":"4ebddc73aede64000600048a","profile_id":"4ebd6a493eae590006000256","text":"","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:47Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:24Z","description":"19 images.

Miller, captures scenes of Baltimore City and its suburbs and of the Frederick to Thurmont line just before electric railroads all but disappeared from these locales. In the early nineteenth century streetcars were a popular means of transportation, carrying workers to places of employment and families to schools, movies, and recreation areas. Used heavily as late as World War II when fuel was rationed and many people relied on public transportation to get around, the streetcar by the early 1950s had lost its battle for riders. The automobile, which had become more affordable and provided more personal freedom, and buses, which were more maneuverable and less obstructive, were replacing the streetcar. By 1952 when Ed Miller took these pictures with a Leica M-3 camera, the streetcar, though still in use, was on its way out. Thus these pictures show a way of life that ended when the last streetcar went out of service -- in Baltimore in 1963, when the last streetcar was retired, and in Frederick/Thurmont in 1955, when the Potomac Edison line converted to diesel engine locomotives.","id":"4ebd6bf63eae590006000487","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82456","name":"Baltimore Transit Co. and Potomac Edison Slides - Baltimore Streetcar Museum","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:52:06Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=23666","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:12Z","id":"4ebddd40aede6400060008a2","profile_id":"4ebd6bf63eae590006000487","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:12Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Science","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:33Z","description":"The Baltimore Transit Directories, Maps, and Timetables exhibit features Baltimore streetcar memorabilia from the personal collection of Jerry Kelly, a member of the Baltimore Streetcar Museum and an avid streetcar buff.

Georgia Marble Company's use of the industrial film medium served to promote its products by capturing in live action the skill and industry required to create \"beauty in stone.\" The first film, New Face on Capitol Hill, depicts Georgia Marble Company's role in the reconstruction of the east fa&ccedil;ade of the U.S. Capitol building prior to John F. Kennedy's inauguration, and includes footage of president John F. Kennedy at his 1961 inauguration, the former vice president Richard M. Nixon, and Architect of the Capitol J. George Stewart. The second film, Producing America's Buried Treasures, focuses more closely on the company's overall history, its quarrying and finishing facilities in Georgia, Tennessee and Vermont, the breadth of applications for Georgia marble products and related limestone and serpentine industries in Alabama and Virginia. Unique to this film are its highlights of uses for processed marble in products that include roofing material, and turf marking for athletic fields. Both Producing America's Buried Treasure and the New Face on Capitol Hill feature the company's marble quarrying and finishing operations in Pickens County, Georgia; both include pictorial examples of marble-quarrying and marble-shaping machinery, of stone cutters working in the quarry, and of craftsmen sculpting the marble. Many beautiful high-quality products were produced by the Georgia Marble Company, and a number of well-known structures comprised of Georgia marble are interspersed throughout both films. Most notable are the statue Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial, and the fa&ccedil;ade of the U.S. Capitol Building, the centerpiece of New Face on Capitol Hill.","id":"4ebd69773eae59000600014f","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81072","name":"Beauty in Stone : the industrial films of the Georgia Marble Company","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:50Z","url":"http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/georgiamarble/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:15Z","id":"4ebddb9faede640006000292","profile_id":"4ebd69773eae59000600014f","text":"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /cgi/\nDisallow: /test/\nDisallow: /templates/\nDisallow: /review/\nDisallow: /ggpd/docs/\n\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:15Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:00Z","description":"This collection consists of twenty-six films of San Francisco from before and after the Great Earthquake and Fire, 1897-1916.

Yellen's correspondence dates from 1948 to 1994 and encompasses a variety of topics: migrant farm workers, water policy, tax assessment, electricity rates, local politics, the law, medical malpractice, and the compounding of prescriptions. The correspondence in each series is supported by an array of published materials, as well as documents from the Brawley city government and newsletters from a variety of small organizations.;Ben Yellen was a loud voice of protest against the entrenched power of California's commercial farmers. Although his primary lawsuit to compel the federal government to enforce the 1902 Reclamation Law did not ultimately lead to the redistribution of land in Imperial Valley, he brought the issue to national attention and caused the big growers significant discomfort and sizable legal bills. His correspondence and lawsuits allege how the politically and economically powerful interests of Imperial Valley sought to silence him by attacking his medical practice and his personal integrity. His incomplete and idiosyncratic collection of newsletters and small publications reveals a web of small, liberal organizations fighting for the rights of the poor. His crusades against the tax and electricity \"swindles\" illustrate the extent to which the special privileges and power of the big growers affected the lives of citizens of Imperial Valley. Finally, Yellen represented a style of liberalism that mixed a strong desire to do good with a dose of paternalism and a powerful sense of individual importance and empowerment.","id":"4ebd695a3eae59000600013e","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?7102071020","name":"Ben Yellen Papers, 1945-1994","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:48Z","url":"http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf0r29n721?&brand=calisphere","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:04Z","id":"4ebddb94aede640006000273","profile_id":"4ebd695a3eae59000600013e","text":"User-Agent: *\nAllow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:04Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:33Z","description":"Born in Springfield, Ohio, Berenice Abbott (1898-1991) began her career in the 1920s in Paris as an assistant to portrait photographer Man Ray.

The bulk of these selected records feature the period between 1920 and 1929, and describe the sporting events, vaudeville, and films brought to the theater, as well as the efforts to ensure its financial success. Handbills and booking correspondence document Georgia-based fighters such as Tiger Flowers and Texas Tanner who sought to fight at the venue in 1927. Douglass and Ben Stein, a white businessman who assumed ownership of the theater between 1927 and 1929, were affiliated with the Theatre Owners Booking Association (T.O.B.A.), a vaudeville circuit. This gave them access to bring prominent acts to Macon's African American community, such as well-known blues musicians Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, comedians Butterbeans and Susie, as well as musicals, revues, and sacred theater. When not hosting live acts, the Douglass also exhibited a wide variety of sound and silent motion pictures. Selected records feature race films (movies made specifically for African American audiences) of producers such as the Norman Film Manufacturing Company and Oscar Micheaux. The selections highlight other Southern African American theaters, such as the Palace Theatre in Valdosta, Georgia, Liberty Theatre in Columbus, Georgia, and the Liberty Theatre in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The Web site also contains indexes to the documents, an introductory essay, and the finding aid for Douglass's business records.","id":"4ebd69773eae59000600014c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81069","name":"Blues, Black vaudeville, and the silver screen, 1912-1930s : selections from the records of Macon's Douglass Theatre","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:49Z","url":"http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/douglass/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:15Z","id":"4ebddb9faede64000600028c","profile_id":"4ebd69773eae59000600014c","text":"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /cgi/\nDisallow: /test/\nDisallow: /templates/\nDisallow: /review/\nDisallow: /ggpd/docs/\n\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:15Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:29:21Z","description":"Selected newspaper clippings covering the Basque, Chinese, Hispanic, Japanese groups that settled in Idaho.","id":"4ebd69813eae59000600015e","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81139","name":"Boise Public Library Ethnic History Archive","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:44:39Z","url":"http://idahodocs.cdmhost.com/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:20Z","id":"4ebddba4aede6400060002ad","profile_id":"4ebd69813eae59000600015e","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:20Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:14Z","description":"This is a selection of digitized full-text English-language books, as well as book covers of Danish, Finnish, French, German, Hebrew, Icelandic, Italian, Japanese, and Swedish translations of fiction works by Tony Hillerman.

This collection presents 41 motion pictures and 28 sound recordings that tell the story of life and work on the Ninety-Six Ranch and of its cowboys, known in the region as buckaroos. Motion pictures produced from 1945 to 1965 by Leslie Stewart, owner of the Ninety-Six Ranch, are also included. An archive of 2,400 still photographs portrays the people, sites, and traditions on other ranches and in the larger community of Paradise Valley, home to persons of Anglo-American, Italian, German, Basque, Swiss, Northern Paiute Indian, and Chinese heritage. About 2,200 of these photographs were made during the folklife project and about 200 photographs date from 1870 to 1958.

The larger collection also includes images of works in the BMA\u2019s collection, regional architecture, and decorative arts. Donations from scholars, organizations, and schools helped build the slide collection beginning in the 1920\u2019s. To reach out to the community, the slides were circulated to the public through the Museum\u2019s Library.  A 1939 BMA membership campaign brochure listed the slides as one of eight major services offered by the Museum.  According to the brochure, \u201cthe Museum places at the disposal of Baltimore its collection of some 6,500 slides \u2013 illustrating great works of all ages and countries.  This collection of slides is in constant use.  Groups, clubs and organizations of every type throughout the city draw on the collection for material for their lectures.  Teachers in the schools and professors in the colleges borrow the slides and use them before groups that total thousands every year.\u201d  Clearly these were an important resource for the community at the time, but with the increasing availability of cheaper and less fragile transparencies and 35mm slides by the 1960\u2019s, they were moved to storage and eventually transferred to the BMA\u2019s Archives and Manuscripts Collections in 2003. The Baltimore Museum of Art was incorporated in 1914, but did not find a suitable home until M. Carey Thomas, longtime companion of philanthropist Mary E. Garrett and executor of her estate, offered Garrett\u2019s mansion for rent to the Museum in 1922.  After settling into the lovely Victorian home at 101 W. Monument St. near Mount Vernon Place, the BMA opened its first exhibition on February 22, 1923.  The Museum remained there until 1929 when construction was completed on a new building designed by John Russell Pope, the architect of the Jefferson Memorial and the West Building of the National Gallery of Art.  The Pope building, situated on the campus of Johns Hopkins University just across from the Wyman Park Dell, was quickly in need of expansion and Pope also designed the Jacobs Wing, Antioch Court, and auditorium additions in 1937.  Further additions such as the Saidie A. May Young People\u2019s Art Center in 1950 helped support the BMA\u2019s growing collection and educational mission. Significant images in this collection include: views of the Museum\u2019s first home in the rarely photographed Garrett mansion which was torn down in 1930; views of the 1929 building designed by John Russell Pope around the time of its construction; views of interior areas of the museum such as the Saidie A. May Young People\u2019s Art Center, Julius Levy Memorial Room, and the Renaissance Room that have since been moved or changed extensively.","id":"4ebd6bf53eae590006000486","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82454","name":"Building and Exhibitions Lantern Slides \u2013 Baltimore Museum of Art","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:52:06Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=43902","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:12Z","id":"4ebddd40aede6400060008a0","profile_id":"4ebd6bf53eae590006000486","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:12Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:53Z","description":"\"The Built Heritage of North Carolina\" provides access to documentation on hundreds of buildings and structures in North Carolina dating from the 1700s to the early 1900s.

Also covered are such lesser known but historically significant structures as the Jordan House in Bertie County (one of the earliest brick buildings in the state) and the Allison-Deaver House in Transylvania County (one of the oldest frame dwellings west of the Blue Ridge). Several buildings in Beaufort, Bethabara, Hillsborough, and Old Salem, as well as Mecklenburg and Wake Counties, are included. For \"Built Heritage,\" the NCSU Libraries is partnering with Preservation North Carolina (PNC) to digitize 2,731 measured drawings and 5,150 photographs and making them accessible in an online image database.

It only took half an hour for a burning, six-story building to turn into a raging, out of control fire that would wreak devastation with flames that reached temperatures of 2200 to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. \n\nNot all of Baltimore's buildings were lost in the fire. Fireproofing technologies had been incorporated into a number of historic buildings that still stand today including the Equitable building located at the southwest corner of North Calvert and East Fayette Streets. Though effective at fire resistance these technologies were not fool proof and lessons were learned that played a role in shaping some of the standards for the fireproofing of buildings today.\n\nThe documents in this collection tell the story of how Baltimore survived the devastation of and rebuilt after the fire of 1904.","id":"4ebd6a7e3eae5900060002b2","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81667","name":"Burnt District Reports - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:50Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=11250","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z","id":"4ebddc9daede64000600053c","profile_id":"4ebd6a7e3eae5900060002b2","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:00Z","description":"The Library of Congress has extensive and varied resources related to the campaign for woman suffrage in the United States.

At its peak in October, 1943, the camp held 4,315 prisoners. The camp was built by the local T.L. James Company on 770 acres about seven miles northwest of Ruston, Louisiana in 1942.\n\nFrom June 1943 to June 1946, the camp served as one of more than 500 prisoner of war camps in the United States. The first 300 men, from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's elite Afrika Korps, arrived in August 1943. In 1944, the captured officers and crew of a German U-Boat were sent to the camp and kept in isolation in a restricted area in order to prevent them from communicating to the enemy that secret German naval codes had fallen into Allied hands.\n\nDuring 1944, French, Austrian, Italian, Czech, Polish, Yugoslav, Romanian, and Russian prisoners were also housed in the camp. During their incarceration in Camp Ruston, the prisoners benefited from food, medical care, and physical surroundings which were better than what their countrymen were experiencing at home. The prisoners engaged in athletic and crafts activities and allowed to organize an orchestra, a theater, and a library.\n\nThose prisoners who were enlisted men were required to work at the camp and for local farms and businesses. Thy picked cotton, felled timber, built roads, and performed other tasks to help solve the domestic labor shortage caused by the war. They were paid in scrip which they could use in the camp canteen.\n\nIn 1944, the U.S. War Department began a program to educate prisoners of war throughout the United States in academic subjects. One source of books was the library of Louisiana Polytechnic Institute (now Louisiana Tech University).\n\nThe Camp Ruston Collection contains the following materials:\n\n    * Copies of National Archives records pertaining to Camp Ruston.\n    * Official maps of the camp and USGS aerial surveys of the area.\n    * Contemporary snapshots of Camp Ruston.\n    * Books from the camp library Drawings, wood carvings, and other artwork crafted by the prisoners.\n    * Items unearthed during Tech's archaeology survey of the site.\n    * Camp Ruston script, Christmas cards, dinner menus, musical concert programs, athletic equipment, and dinnerware.","id":"4ebd69dc3eae5900060001a3","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81343","name":"Camp Ruston Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:01Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_CMPRT.php?CISOROOT=/CMPRT","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:17Z","id":"4ebddbddaede640006000327","profile_id":"4ebd69dc3eae5900060001a3","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:17Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":[],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:33Z","description":"Campus Archival Documents includes documents pertaining to the history of Sangamon State University (1970-1995) and its successor, the University of Illinois at Springfield (1995-present).

The change of the city through its photographed character focuses on the major industries (the port, construction, transportation) during a period of racial integration, labor disputes and urban growth. As the Franck Collection approaches the present day, the photographs of major building projects (the Louisiana Superdome, bridges across the Mississippi River, nuclear power plants and petrochemical complexes) touch in issues of suburban and exurban expansion, and environmental concerns. The construction and real estate trades furnished the lion's share of the studio's projects. But other types of photography marked the vibrancy of a large and diversified practice: accident scene photography admissible in court cases; copy work of many types; portraiture; and aerial views. Sprinkled throughout are images of social gatherings, private parties, religious ceremonies and public events such as Mardi Gras. Many of the company's photographs from the second half of the 20th century reveal changes to a New Orleans skyline that had remained nearly static since the construction of the Hibernia Bank Building. Charles Franck had photographed the building of this structure, topped with a reproduction miniature Roman temple, completed in 1921. From mundane to dramatic and routine to historical, the negatives and prints of the Charles L. Franck and Franck-Bertacci Collections open a window to the architecture and urban landscape of New Orleans and its surroundings during the second half of the 20th century.","id":"4ebd69e03eae5900060001a6","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81347","name":"Charles L.

The violent confrontation between Chicago police and labor protesters in 1886 proved to be a pivotal setback in the struggle for American workers' rights. These materials pertain to: the May 4, 1886 meeting and bombing; to the trial, conviction and subsequent appeals of those accused of inciting the bombing; and to the execution of four of the convicted and the later pardon of the remaining defendants. Of special interest and significance are the two dozen images of three-dimensional artifacts, including contemporary Chicago Police Department paraphernalia, labor banners, and an unexploded bomb casing given to juror J.

The collections consist of works from the Sung, Yuan, Ming, and Ch'ing dynasties, including major figure paintings and bird-and-flower paintings. The greatest strength, however, is landscape paintings. Considered the highest category of painting in China, the landscape embodies the ideals of the Confucian scholar.

Coverage begins with white churches' conversion efforts, especially in the post-Revolutionary period, and depicts the tensions and contradictions between the egalitarian potential of evangelical Christianity and the realities of slavery.

The Wilmington Coal Field is located sixty miles south of Chicago. The growth of the city and its need for energy prompted the search for coal in this area. In the late 1800's and very early 1900's many of the small villages in the area were built. Due to the proximity of coal to the ground surface, shaft mining was dangerous and expensive. Strip mining was first introduced in the Danville, Illinois area in the mid 1800's and it was tried in the early 1900's in the Wilmington Coal Fields but it wasn't until the end of the 1920's that strip mining became commercially successful in this area. This collection includes information on the mining process, how strip mining affected the communities and how they have recovered and continue to progress today.","id":"4ebd68ff3eae590006000093","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2743","name":"Coal Mining in Illinois, Machine vs. Man","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:01Z","url":"http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/ccpl","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:17Z","id":"4ebddb29aede640006000100","profile_id":"4ebd68ff3eae590006000093","text":"User-agent: *\r\nAllow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:17Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:08Z","description":"This digital collection consists of photographic prints made, for the most part, by The Cobbs Studio, which operated in Albuquerque, New Mexico from 1885 to 1942.

Two hundred twenty four men were also named as defendants who were allegedly involved in the Bisbee Deportation of July 12, 1917. The Bisbee Deportation started as a labor dispute between some members of the International Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union and the three mining companies in early June of 1917. The issues were focused on working rules, safety regulations and the requirement for a physical examination, rather than wages and benefits. With the arrival of hundreds of Industrial Workers of the World sympathizers in late June who were vowing to shut down all the copper mines from Montana to Mexico, the conflict intensified and culminated in a community action on July 12, 1917.","id":"4ebd6a253eae59000600020b","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81455","name":"Cochise County Clerk of Superior Court - Bisbee Deportation Documents","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:23Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/ccobisb","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:58Z","id":"4ebddc42aede6400060003f6","profile_id":"4ebd6a253eae59000600020b","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:58Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:04Z","description":"The theme of this collection is the unique history and culture of Southeastern Arizona.

The 652 page collection contains brief notations by the district court clerk of matters and proceedings taken up by the judge&mdash;in the order they were presented. Aficionados of Cochise County Territorial history will enjoy \"seeing\" the characters of the day make their appearance in court&mdash;and getting a sense of the cadence of court business procedures from a time long past.\n\nCriminal cases, jury empanelment, mining company lawsuits, divorces, the granting of U. S. citizenship, and the admission of attorneys to practice law in the county make up the bulk of these minutes. District Judge W. H. Stilwell and Associate Justices Wilson W. Hoover and D. H. Pinney preside over the likes of C. S. Fly, John Clum, Phineas Clanton, John Behan, J. H. \"Doc\" Holliday, Thomas Jeffords, John Ringo, William Claiborn, Frank Stilwell, George Hearst, Pete Spencer, Zwing Hunt, Ah Chung and Wyatt Earp.\n\nOriginal documents from the court files have been scattered to the winds, some have disappeared from the public domain, others can be found in public repositories. In some cases, these minutes are the only remnants of what occurred that day in court. With the ink in the book fading and this way of doing business having been replaced by computer technology, we knew we must act to preserve this piece of history by microfilming and digitizing. University of Arizona South intern Rebecca Hidalgo, working under the professorship of Dr. Todd Lutes, performed all the metadata input which was invaluable in making this collection possible for the Arizona Memory Project.

The Civil War in many areas of the Trans-Mississippi theater have been relatively unnoticed by scholars, and few digitized materials are available from the region. As a result, the larger community does not fully understand the role the Ozarks played in the War. It is the goal of this project to unify collections scattered throughout the Ozarks by making them available to researchers online. This project focuses on the consequences and effects of the war on community, families, economy, and culture. The Library District partnered with: Dr. William Piston and David Richards at Missouri State University, the History Museum for Springfield-Greene County, the Greene County Archives and Records Center, the Jasper County Records Center, the Western Historical Manuscript Collection at the University of Missouri Rolla, and the Wilson\u2019s Creek National Battlefield to develop the scope and themes of Community and Conflict. Together partners have identified collections within their holdings and beyond. This digital collection is designed to eliminate barriers to access by providing historical letters, journals, diaries, court cases and other materials to researchers online. These collections tell the stories and explore the many facets of life during the most turbulent time in the history of the Ozarks. Project staff developed a planning and development manual for digitization projects to provide insight to the logistical operations of digitization projects, tips for selecting and evaluating collections, guidelines for scanning, metadata and transcriptions, and strategies for building strong partnerships with other organizations.  The Library District offers this resource to assist other institutions with their digitization projects.","id":"4ebd6b803eae590006000360","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82014","name":"Community & Conflict: The Impact of the Civil War in the Ozarks","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:16Z","url":"http://www.ozarkscivilwar.org/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:29Z","id":"4ebddcd9aede640006000674","profile_id":"4ebd6b803eae590006000360","text":"User-agent: *\nDisallow:\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:29Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:06Z","description":"The John J.

Creating Your Community: Empowering Individuals and Safeguarding Communal Heritage Through Digital Community Archiving will build on the Creating Communities concept by expanding the partner base to the greater Denver area. Our intended model is based on the concept of Participatory Archives, which allows a user to add content and interact, as well as access archival collections from the community itself as well as institutions. As a platform for community generated materials, the project will provide a new and exciting way for content to be showcased. Through audience participation and contributions, giving up top down control and design will democratize the content that users and the community contribute. Using social network tools and ideas will increase the knowledge of what library, museum, archive, and community organizations have in their collections as well as encourage donations. Rather than the partners being the main content provider, the community at large will be the content supplier. By encouraging digital rights donation of born digital content and offering a new ways of donating we will fill in gaps in our partners collections as well as in the area\u2019s history.","id":"4ebd69813eae59000600015c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81137","name":"Creating  Your Community","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:54Z","url":"http://creatingcommunities.denverlibrary.org/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:19Z","id":"4ebddba3aede6400060002a9","profile_id":"4ebd69813eae59000600015c","text":"# $Id: robots.txt,v 1.9.2.1 2008/12/10 20:12:19 goba Exp $\n#\n# robots.txt\n#\n# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts\n# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!\n# and Google.

Both W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington wrote articles for the national press about their visits with members of Durham's African-American community. After his visit in 1910, Booker T. Washington dubbed Durham the \"City of Negro Enterprises.\" The Digital Durham website offers students, teachers, and researchers a range of primary sources with which they can investigate the economic, social, cultural, and political history of a post-bellum southern community. Letters from mothers to daughters, parents to children, and husbands and wives give insight into the domestic lives of some of Durham's elite citizens.   Entries from Atlas Rigsbee's general store ledger together with data from the 1880 census provide a view into the social experience of those Durham citizens who have not left written documents. Taken together the new materials on Digital Durham touch on over 600 topics including African American business enterprise, the emergence of textiles, tobacco production and marketing, child labor, prohibition, evangelical revivalism, nineteenth-century medical practices, women's experience of childbirth, and public and private education. The holdings of the website provide access to a wide range of manuscript and printed materials from the 1870s through the 1920s. The site also features a new collection of maps that depict Durham from the late 1860s to the present day. Digital Durham offers its users a selection of manuscript letters taken from the Southgate-Jones family papers and James Southgate papers, accounts from Atlas M. Rigsbee's general store ledger, photographs, ephemera, census data, printed works as well as a rich collection of maps. The site also includes audio postcards created by Duke students in an undergraduate research seminar on the history of Durham and the New South. Additionally, the site includes resources for K-12 educators--a reference section with glossary of terms used in the 1880 census and lesson plans that tie to the North Carolina Standard Course of Study.","id":"4ebd6b813eae590006000363","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82017","name":"Digital Durham","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:16Z","url":"http://digitaldurham.duke.edu/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:30Z","id":"4ebddcdaaede640006000678","profile_id":"4ebd6b813eae590006000363","text":"User-agent: duke-crawler\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/*\r\n\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:54Z","description":"Digital Forsyth, the definitive online collection of historical photographs of Forsyth County, NC., is a grant-funded multi-year digitization project among Forsyth County Public Library, Old Salem Museum and Gardens, Winston-Salem State University's C.G.

Lange's concern for people, her appreciation of the ordinary, and the striking empathy she showed for her subjects make her unique among photographers of her day.\n\nBeginning as a commercial portrait photographer in 1920s San Francisco, Lange's early documentary work included images of Native Americans, made on travels to the Southwest with her first husband, painter Maynard Dixon. By the early 1930s, studio work seemed limited and static to Lange; almost intuitively, she took her camera to the streets, to the breadlines, waterfront strikes, and down-and-out people of Depression-era San Francisco.\n\nIn 1935 Lange began her landmark work for the California and Federal Resettlement Administrations (later the Farm Security Administration).\n\nCollaborating with her second husband, labor economist Paul Schuster Taylor, she documented the troubled exodus of farm families escaping the dust bowl as they migrated West in search of work. Lange's documentary style achieved its fullest expression in these years, with photographs such as \"Migrant Mother\" becoming instantly recognized symbols of the migrant experience. Coupled with Taylor's essays and captions, her photographs were hailed as persuasive evidence of the urgent need for government programs to assist disadvantaged Americans.\n\nAlthough the coming of World War II brought an end to Lange's FSA work, the war opened a new chapter in her life as a photographer. During the war, Lange documented the forced relocation of Japanese American citizens to internment camps; recorded the efforts of women and minority workers in wartime industries at California shipyards; and covered the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco. Only illness prevented her from completing a1940 Simon Guggenheim Foundation grant to travel the country photographing the American people.\n\nThis dedication and compassion drove Lange even during the final years of her life. In the 1950s and 60s she produced vivid photographic essays on Ireland, Asia. Egypt, Midwestern utopian communities, and the post-war industrial scene of the Bay Area.\n\nDorothea Lange died in 1965. The following year, her unique collection became a gift to the Oakland Museum of California from her husband, Paul Schuster Taylor. The collection includes Lange's personal negative file of more than 25,000 images, over 6,000 vintage prints, and a selection from Lange's personal papers and library.\n\nLong utilized by researchers--as is shown by published books: Dorothea Lange: A Visual Life; Photographing The Second Gold Rush: Dorothea Lange and the Bay Area at War, 1941-1945; and Dorothea Lange's Ireland--the archive is impressive in its depth and breadth.","id":"4ebd68ae3eae590006000046","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2530","name":"Dorothea Lange Collection 1919-1965","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:47Z","url":"http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3f59n5wt/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:25Z","id":"4ebddaf5aede640006000075","profile_id":"4ebd68ae3eae590006000046","text":"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /\nAllow: /escholarship\n\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nUser-agent: Googlebot-Image\nUser-agent: Slurp\nUser-agent: msnbot\nUser-agent: Teoma\nUser-agent: ArchitextSpider\nUser-agent: UC-crawler\nDisallow: /books\nDisallow: /cdl\nDisallow: /check_dynaxml\nDisallow: /cms\nDisallow: /cui\nDisallow: /cgi\nDisallow: /escholarship2\nDisallow: /includes\nDisallow: /loadTest\nDisallow: /log_analysis\nDisallow: /logs\nDisallow: /yui\nDisallow: /search\n###Disallow: /view\nDisallow: /xtf/search\n###Disallow: /xtf/view\nDisallow: /test\nDisallow: /ucpress\nDisallow: /ucpress2\nDisallow: /*.xml$\nAllow: /ark\nAllow: /escholarship\nAllow: /sitemap\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:25Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:03Z","description":"The Documentary Drawings category includes more than 3,000 drawings made between 1750 and 1970.

The collection complements the Library of Congress exhibition Religion and the Founding of the American Republic and is a collaborative venture between the Library of Congress and The Library of Virginia.","id":"4ebd6b8b3eae5900060003a4","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82099","name":"Early Virginia Religious Petitions","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:56Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/petitions/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:39Z","id":"4ebddce3aede6400060006f9","profile_id":"4ebd6b8b3eae5900060003a4","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:39Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:43Z","description":"Published yearly since 1919, and well illustrated, the Warbler conveys information on students and faculty, chronicles important cultural and sporting events, describes organizational activities, and depicts changes in the campus layout and physical  plant.

During 2003-2004, approximately 200 texts were digitized pertaining to the history of 29 eastern North Carolina counties. Principle Investigator for 2003-2004, Elizabeth Smith, and her colleagues in Joyner Library's North Carolina Collection were responsible for the selection of these titles. The materials were selected from the North Carolina Collection and the Snow L. and B.W. Roberts Collection of over 1,100 works of fiction set in North Carolina dating from 1734. Some materials related to Dare County were selected from the Outer Banks History Center collection. Working with members of the Digital Initiatives team in the Joyner Systems department to bring these pages to life, Smith's project became an immediate success. In 2004-2005, Joyner Library partnered with Historic Hope Foundation, Tobacco Farm Life Museum, the Country Doctor Museum and members of ECU's College of Education to expand the North Carolina History and Fiction Digital Library. The successful recipient of the first three-year Heritage Partners grant awarded by NC ECHO, Joyner and its partners are making available over 20,000 additional pages of historic texts related to eastern North Carolina, zoomable maps, zoomable images and video footage of museum artifacts, and related alignments and lesson plans for North Carolina educators. Focus groups with area educators were held to help us refine the site to better meet the needs of teachers and students. In the current grant year, 2005-2006, under the direction of Emily Gore, Project Manager, the North Carolina History and Fiction Digital Library became the Eastern North Carolina Digital Library. The name was changed from the North Carolina History and Fiction Digital Library to a more encompassing title that will allow for the development of a broader digital library, as well as a name that is easier to remember and say! In addition to a name change, the site received an overhaul based largely on input received from teachers during workshops. During 2005-2006, additional partnerships were established with the New Hanover County Public Library and UNCW's Randall Library to add approximately 11,000 pages of historic Southeastern NC texts to the site. Approximately 100 additional artifacts with relevant data, videos and zoomable images from the museums were added, as well as 20+ additional lesson plans and activities from Eastern North Carolina teachers. In 2006-2007, the Classroom Resources section of the site will be enhanced and many more lessons and activities will be available for classroom use. This project brings together local history materials, historical fiction related to these localities, and museum artifacts that highlight Eastern North Carolina's rich past.","id":"4ebd6b813eae590006000364","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82018","name":"Eastern North Carolina Digital Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:16Z","url":"http://digital.lib.ecu.edu/historyfiction/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:30Z","id":"4ebddcdaaede64000600067a","profile_id":"4ebd6b813eae590006000364","text":"# Reece: 1/29/2011 - removed /jlead/ and /encdigital/ disallows\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /search.aspx\r\nDisallow: /reflector/search.aspx\r\nDisallow: /special/ead/results.aspx\r\nDisallow: /special/ead/view.aspx","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Language Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:04Z","description":"On January 19, 1934, under the direction of Joseph L. Wheeler, the Enoch Pratt Free Library opened the Edgar Allan Poe Room to the public. Pratt's collection of Poeana has been bolstered over the years by three major gifts. The first, a gift of letters, books, clippings and other memorabilia was presented to the Library by Margaret Cheston Carey, niece of Amelia Fitzgerald Poe in 1936. The Amelia Poe material contains many of the letters in Pratt's possession, including those written by Poe to Maria Clemm, his aunt and to Virginia Clemm, his 13 year-old cousin who he later married. The well-known lock of Poe's hair from the Amelia Poe gift was taken from his head the day after his death in 1849. In 1942 Pratt became the beneficiary of the collection of Sara Sigourney Rice. Among the numerous clippings and letters in the Rice collection are notes written to Miss Rice regarding the poet by Tennyson, Whittier, Holmes, Longfellow and others. The third installment of Poe material came as part of a large gift to the Library by the children of Joseph Katz in 1960. Mr. Katz, a local advertising executive, was also known as one of the important collectors of books of Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century writers. Following his death in 1958 his collection of more than 3500 books was turned over to the Pratt Library by sons Leslie and Richard Katz and daughter Ruth Strouse. Mr. Katz's eclectic collection includes not only books but also other memorabilia including images and daguerreotypes of the poet and significant others in his life. The gifts of these three benefactors are among the many treasures of the Pratt collection. They have been supplemented by other gifts and acquisitions including an important oil painting executed for the Library by Thomas Corner in the early 1930's which was based on the now famous Whitman Daguerreotype held at Brown University.","id":"4ebd6b503eae590006000314","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81819","name":"Edgar Allan Poe Collection - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:56Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=180","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:56Z","id":"4ebddcb8aede6400060005ef","profile_id":"4ebd6b503eae590006000314","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:56Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:41Z","description":"Edison's laboratory was responsible for the invention of the Kinetograph (a motion picture camera) and the Kinetoscope (a peep-hole motion picture viewer). Most of this work was performed by Edison's assistant, William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, beginning in 1888. Motion pictures became a successful entertainment industry in less than a decade, with single-viewer Kinetoscopes giving way to films projected for mass audiences. The Edison Manufacturing Co. (later known as Thomas A. Edison, Inc.) not only built the apparatus for filming and projecting motion pictures, but also produced films for public consumption. Most early examples were actualities showing famous people, news events, disasters, people at work, new modes of travel and technology, scenic views, expositions, and other leisure activities. As actualities declined in popularity, the company's production emphasis shifted to comedies and dramas.;This collection features 341 Edison films, including 127 titles also available in other American Memory motion picture groupings. The earliest example is a camera test made in 1891, followed by other tests and a wide variety of actualities and dramas through the year 1918, when Edison's company ceased film production. The presentation also offers a brief history of Edison's work with motion pictures as well as an overview of the different film genres produced by the Edison company.","id":"4ebd691d3eae5900060000d6","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?70442635","name":"Edison Motion Pictures","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:13Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/edhtml/edmvhm.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:55Z","id":"4ebddb4faede6400060001a6","profile_id":"4ebd691d3eae5900060000d6","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:55Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:52Z","description":"The collection includes eneral histories of early public schooling in Illinois, as well as histories of various colleges and universities in the state.

In 1886 Peattie began to write for the Chicago Tribune. Her talent distinguished her, and she soon became the first woman reporter for the Tribune and the second \"girl\" reporter in Chicago. Two years later, the couple moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where she and her husband both worked for the Omaha World-Herald. Her writings depict not only the transformations of Omaha in the 1890s toward the progressive, just society that she envisioned but also reflect the passion of a woman convinced of each individual's ability to effect positive, lasting change within society. Because she published in diverse newspapers and periodicals for approximately fifty years (1882-1932), a definitive bibliography would be nearly impossible to collect.","id":"4ebd6a4a3eae590006000259","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81536","name":"Elia Peattie: an Uncommon Writer, an Uncommon Woman","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:35Z","url":"http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/peattie/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:48Z","id":"4ebddc74aede640006000490","profile_id":"4ebd6a4a3eae590006000259","text":"","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:48Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Science"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:54Z","description":"Program for the reception and banquet given in honor of Elisha Gray on November 15, 1878.

JARP is considered one of the finest collections of primary sources in the United States on Japanese immigration history. Conducted under the sponsorship of the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL), JARP was a socio-historical research project which began in 1962 and lasted until 1972. During the course of the project, the JARP staff amassed a sizable body of material in the Japanese language which became the core of the JARP Collection. Additions were made as they were obtained.;The Ishigo Papers is part of the Nisei personal papers section of JARP's manuscript holdings.

He not only participated in the transition from horses to steam engines to gas tractors, but recorded that transition through the eye of his camera, thus capturing forever an important part of American agricultural history. Although the subject content is narrow, it is the concentration of closely related images in a relatively short time span which makes it such an interesting collection. Subject strengths include plowing, disking, seeding, binding grain, threshing, and the machinery used for these operations\u2014steam engines and tractors. There are also images of the agricultural laborers who worked the fields, and several social scenes of the family.

These facilities varied from private academies to public schools, from well-known establishments to tiny neighborhood classrooms. The reason for this proliferation lies in the Quaker belief that everyone, regardless of gender, race or class, is both deserving and capable of an education. Women were regarded as the intellectual equals of men, and the practice of slavery was frowned upon; as such, some of the earliest schools in the county both for women and for African Americans were founded in Sandy Spring. \n\nIn 1850, Richard and Mary Kirk took over the school, with William H. Farquhar as Principal.  Mary Coffin, a young woman from New York state, taught at Fair Hill from 1854 to 1865, when the school closed.  Her memoirs, published in 1916, provide a wealth of detail about the school during its last decade.  According to her recollections, the school averaged 45 students a year, primarily drawing from Montgomery County.  About a quarter of the students were Friends (Quakers), and some of these girls were from Quaker families in DC and Alexandria. \n\nIn the early days of the Civil War, nearly two-thirds of the students withdrew, because of the school's proximity to the fighting in Baltimore.   The school closed for good in 1865 (the building itself burned down in the 1970s), although the Fair Hill Fund continued to provide money for local education.","id":"4ebd6a803eae5900060002b4","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81669","name":"Fair Hill Boarding School letters - Montgomery County Historical Society","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=312","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z","id":"4ebddc9daede640006000540","profile_id":"4ebd6a803eae5900060002b4","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Science"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:14Z","description":"Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden is a leading center of palm research, horticulture, and conservation.

Their appearance in print was incidental. At the time of his death, eighteen plays that we now attribute to him had not reached print. They include some of his greatest and most popular - Julius Caesar, As You Like It, Twelfth Night, Antony and Cleopatro, Coriolanus, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest. These plays, along with alternative versions of some of those that had been printed, survived in manuscripts of various kinds, and were kept at the theater's where they were performed. At least two of the plays were printed from these manuscripts.\n\nThe folio as a format was reserved for only the most expensive and prestigious volumes by the leading theologians, philosophers and historians of the day. A folio devoted to plays was unprecedented. The printing of the 907-page First Folio began early in 1622 and took nearly two years to complete. Of the 36 plays in the Folio, twelve appear to have been set up from earlier printed quartos that had been annotated from a manuscript playbook: Titus Andronicus, Richard III, Love's Labour's Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, The Merchant of Venice, 1 Henry IV, Much Ado About Nothing, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida, and The Tragedy of King Lear. The playbooks themselves were apparently used as copy for only three plays in the Folio: Julius Caesar, As You Like It, and Macbeth. Another nine were set from Shakespeare's foul papers: The Taming of the Shrew, The First Part of the Contention (2 Henry VI), Richard Duke of York (3 Henry VI), 1 Henry VI, The Comedy of Errors, Henry V, All's Well That Ends Well, Timon of Athens, and Antony and Cleopatra. Six were from transcripts made by unidentified scribes: King John, 2 Henry IV, Twelfth Night, Othello, Coriolanus, and All Is True (Henry VIII).\n\nThe first folio was so successful and demand apparently so great that a second edition was required within less than a decade. The Second Folio was a carefully corrected page-for-page reprint of the first that made hundreds of minor changes in the text, the majority of which have been accepted by modern editors. The preliminaries of the Second Folio include John Milton's first published poem, 'An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatic Poet W. Shakespeare'.   The Third Folio appeared in 1663, with a second issue in 1664 that added Pericles and six apocryphal plays: The London Prodigal, Thomas, Lord Cromwell, Sir John Oldcastle, The Puritan, A Yorkshire Tragedy, and Locrine. The Fourth Folio was published in 1685.\n\nThe books of Shakespeare's time were subject to stop-press correction, with the result that individual copies may differ slightly from each other.","id":"4ebd6b513eae590006000319","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81824","name":"Folios of William Shakespeare","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:56Z","url":"http://digital.lib.muohio.edu/cdm4/shakespeare/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:57Z","id":"4ebddcb9aede6400060005f7","profile_id":"4ebd6b513eae590006000319","text":"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:57Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Language Arts","Religion","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:10Z","description":"Folkstreams.net collects, preserves, and makes available free streaming video of hard-to-find documentary films about American folk or roots culture, giving wider audience to the independent filmmakers and the diverse American artists and groups they have documented.

The minutes also chronicle the relationships between the Athens Woman's Club and various other organizations of local, state and national significance such as the Georgia Federation of Women's Clubs and the General Federation of Women's Clubs. The materials help define the complexity of regional roles and events, with particular regards to the Club's delayed participation in the national suffrage movement. Chartered in 1899, the Athens Woman's Club, like many other women's clubs in Georgia and throughout the United States, was originally formed as a literary club dedicated to the educational and cultural development of its members. Over the next two decades, the club gradually directed its efforts to serve the community beyond its membership by embarking upon social reform and civic improvement initiatives. The following set of minutes illuminates this critical transition and the notable work performed by members of the Athens Woman's Club, who fundraised, lobbied and organized to support relief efforts during World War I, to establish institutions such as the Ella F. White Memorial School and the Crawford Long Infirmary, and to persuade university trustees to admit women as students at the University of Georgia.","id":"4ebd69773eae590006000150","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81073","name":"For our mutual benefit : The Athens Woman's Club and social reform, 1899-1920","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:50Z","url":"http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/athenswomansclub/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:16Z","id":"4ebddba0aede640006000294","profile_id":"4ebd69773eae590006000150","text":"User-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /cgi/\nDisallow: /test/\nDisallow: /templates/\nDisallow: /review/\nDisallow: /ggpd/docs/\n\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:16Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:14Z","description":"This collection is comprised of black and white photographs and negatives taken of Vietnamese and Cambodian refugees living at Fort Chaffee, a military base in Arkansas.

He spent over sixty years photographing the people and events of his region.\n\nThe subject content of the collection is very diverse, ranging from early sod homes, to farming scenes, to small town life, to social events, and to education on the prairie. Subject strengths include: sod buildings, farming, one-room schools, women, children, and stores & shops in small town America. There are images of plowing, threshing, steam engines, and horses. Weather, always a major concern, includes blizzards, snow, and winter. Other images contain scenes of eating & drinking, hunting, celebrations, and women's organizations. The ethnic diversity of the region is evident with the numerous images of Norwegian Americans, Icelandic Americans, Canadian Americans, British Americans, and others.

From 1939 to 1953 the Library underwent a myriad of changes that established the institution as one of America\u2019s foremost citadels of intellectual freedom. Archibald MacLeish and Luther Harris Evans, Librarians of Congress during this time, adopted new administrative procedures that improved the Library\u2019s ability to acquire collections and made it a more vital resource both for Congress and the public during and after the war. The theme of this online presentation refers to the title of Lucy Salamanca\u2019s book, Fortress of Freedom: The Story of the Library of Congress (1942). Salamanca, a Library of Congress employee, wrote with a strong sense of the importance of the institution as a beacon of knowledge and haven for the written word during a significant time in American history. The 209 letters, memoranda, photographs, and Library of Congress publications presented here (1,176 images in all) are from the Library of Congress Archives as well as other relevant manuscript collections found in the Manuscript Division.","id":"4ebd6b953eae5900060003af","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82111","name":"Freedom's Fortress: The Library of Congress, 1939-1953","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:56Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/freedoms_fortress/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:40Z","id":"4ebddce4aede64000600070f","profile_id":"4ebd6b953eae5900060003af","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:40Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:53Z","description":"The News-Messenger is the only daily newspaper headquartered in Sandusky County, Ohio.

Thanks to a nearly quarter-million dollar grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the history of education and arts literacy in the Smokies will be preserved and accessible to all. The University of Tennessee Libraries, in partnership with the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts and the Pi Beta Phi Elementary School, Gatlinburg, TN, will create a fully-searchable digital collection of letters, diaries, photographs, and short printed items that document the history of the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School and Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nThe digital collection will also feature integrated curriculum packages for students at the current Pi Beta Phi Elementary School, a K-8 school originally started as the settlement school. An exhibition, mirroring the online archives, will be mounted at the Arrowmont gallery and will be open to the public.\n\nThe project is directed by two principal investigators, Anne Bridges and Ken Wise. Anne and Ken also co-direct The University of Tennessee Library's Great Smoky Mountains Regional Project (GSMRP). While the Pi Beta Phi-Arrowmont project operates on a two-year timeline, the GSMRP is a long-term initiative designed to support research about the Smokies through collection development, bibliography and digital projects.\n\nThis website describes the Pi Beta Phi-Arrowmont project's scope, goals, and milestones; introduces the grant staff members; and chronicles the grant project's activities and progress over the two-year grant period. The site also features sample images from the collection as it is being built and brief essays describing some of the educational areas addressed by the Pi Beta Phi Settlement School.

Transcripts of interviews with U.S. diplomatic personnel capture their experiences, motivations, critiques, personal analyses, and private thoughts.  These elements are crucial to understanding the full story of how a structure of stable relationships that maintained world peace and protected U.S. interests and values was built. The interviews in the collection are mostly with Foreign Service Officers but there also are some with political appointees and other officials.  While some 1920s-, 1930s-, and World-War-II-era diplomacy is covered, most of the interviews involve post-World-War-II diplomacy, from the late 1940s to the 1990s.  This collection captures the post-World-War-II period in vivid terms and intimate detail, documenting the way that U.S. diplomacy defends the United States and its interests in a challenging world.  The narratives span the major diplomatic crises and issues that faced the United States during the second half of the 20th century and, as new interviews are added, will include developments in the 21st century.  The 1,658 transcripts of oral history interviews were donated by the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST), a private, nonprofit organization. The statements, views, and opinions contained in the interviews do not necessarily represent those of the United States government, its agencies, or the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.

The writings include sermons, addresses, and other writings on various subjects, such as slavery, prayer, and treatment for disease.

The collection of papers includes both personal and denominational correspondence, as well as sermons, speeches, and original poetry. Materials personally accumulated by Furman include booklets and papers that belonged to other family members, including his wives, Harriet Eloise and Mary Glenn Davis Furman, and Hannah Bowers Furman. The Furman Family Papers consist mainly of personal correspondence of Richard Furman's family and descendants from 1782 to 1960. Included in the Furman family collection are writings, such as diaries, essays, poetry, and prose. Receipts, legal documents, remedies, and recipes are included, as well as biographical manuscripts on Gabriel Furman, Josiah Furman, Richard Furman, III, Samuel Furman, and Wood Furman.

The studio closed four years later due to poor business.\nHe was then employed as an assayer's clerk at the New Orleans branch of\nthe United States Mint. In the 1850s, the collodion, or wet-plate,\nprocess was used for Mugnier's stereoscopic photographs. In the 1870s\nthe dry-plate and gelatin-silver bromide processes became popular. The\nmass production and availability beginning in the 1880s of dry plate\nglass negative allowed photographers the flexibility and technology to\nleave the confines of the portrait studio. George Francois Mugnier\nseized the opportunity and created a series of a photographs of the\npeople and sites of New Orleans and southern Louisiana during the 1880s\nto 1920s. In 1930 G.F. Mugnier sold his collection of glass negatives a\nselection of vintage prints and stereograph cards to the Louisiana State\nMuseum.

Document types in the collection as a whole include correspondence, letterbooks, commonplace books, diaries, journals, financial account books, military records, reports, and notes accumulated by Washington from 1741 through 1799. The collection is organized into nine Series or groupings. Commonplace books, correspondence, and travel journals, document his youth and early adulthood as a Virginia county surveyor and as colonel of the militia during the French and Indian War. Washington's election as delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses and his command of the American army during the Revolutionary war are well documented as well as his two presidential administrations from 1789 through 1797. Because of the wide range of Washington's interests, activities, and correspondents, which include ordinary citizens as well as celebrated figures, his papers are a rich source for almost every aspect of colonial and early American history. In its online presentation, the George Washington Papers consists of approximately 152,000 images.

The 2,200 sq. ft. building would serve a population of 3,500. The Spanish-style mission library was located in the center of Murphy Park. It was built in the form of a \"T\", with an arched entrance in the center which led to the reading rooms. It was considered one of the most attractive buildings in the city.\n\nOn June 1, 1935, Mrs. Velma Teague was hired as head librarian and served until her death in 1969. She recognized the need for excellent books to stimulate young and old minds. She dreamed that a larger library would one day replace the smaller one in Murphy Park. Preliminary plans were approved for a larger library in 1967. Mrs. Teague died in 1969 before the new 15,000 sq. ft. library was finished, but she knew that the new library would be named for her. The Velma Teague Library opened in September 1971.\n\nAs the city continued to grow, it became apparent that a much larger library was needed. Under the directorship of Rodeane Widom, a new 65,000 sq. ft. main library opened in July 1987 next door to Sahuaro Ranch Park. The downtown library remained open as a branch.\n\nIn July 1998, the Foothills Branch Library opened. This 33,500 sq. ft. branch library is the first library in Arizona to offer the convenience of a drive up window.","id":"4ebd6a2f3eae59000600021c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81473","name":"Glendale Public Library History","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:26Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/gplhis","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:11Z","id":"4ebddc4faede640006000418","profile_id":"4ebd6a2f3eae59000600021c","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:11Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:51Z","description":"Photographs of the Glenview Public Library.","id":"4ebd6bbb3eae59000600043b","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82377","name":"Glenview Area History","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:26Z","url":"http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/glenview001","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:26Z","id":"4ebddd12aede64000600080a","profile_id":"4ebd6bbb3eae59000600043b","text":"User-agent: *\r\nAllow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:26Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Religion"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:59Z","description":"The Goodspeed Collection of New Testament Manuscripts comprises 65 early Greek, Syriac, Ethiopic, Armenian, Arabic, and Latin manuscripts ranging in date from the 7th to the 19th centuries.

One of its unique natural areas is the Grand Mere Dunes area. Although the dunes now make up a state park, in 1960 the area was the site of sand mining. Industry attempts to remove all the sand from the dunes and fill in two lakes met with much local opposition, resulting in the formation of the Grand Mere Association. Thanks to the Lincoln Township Public Library, the Making of Modern Michigan website has digital images pertaining to the Grand Mere Association, and its role in the rescue and preservation of the Grand Mere Dunes. The material outlines how only after years of effort from the association were the dunes made into a state park. Furthermore, the association\u2019s papers and resources offer a valuable example of a successful local political effort to save an ecological treasure. As part of this LSTA-funded project, a local naturalist and member of the Grand Mere Association gave a presentation on the Dunes. As a result of that presentation, landscapers in the area have promoted the use of native species and natural landscaping for lakefront homes, allowing the homes to blend into the dunes.","id":"4ebd6b733eae590006000359","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82006","name":"Grand Mere","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:11Z","url":"http://mmm.lib.msu.edu/search/browsecollections.cfm?t=1&user=44","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:24Z","id":"4ebddcd4aede640006000668","profile_id":"4ebd6b733eae590006000359","text":"# ROBOTS.TXT\n# Rwhw 20 June 2002\n# Disallow all robots\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /\n\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:24Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Health","Science","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:30:07Z","description":"These images represent just a portion of our collection of over 7,000 photographs that relate to the University of Nevada School of Medicine; the Nevada State Medical Association and member societies; the Reno Surgical Society; 19th-century frontier military medicine in the Great Basin; and Nevada hospitals, doctors, nurses, dentists, and veterinarians.

This man who never went to school beyond the age of fifteen years and nine months taught himself to write and became one of the most distinguished stylists in prose nonfiction in the history of American letters. In his second floor study at 1524 Hollins Street, Mencken pecked away at his small Corona and produced prose which ranks with that of Mark Twain, Benjamin Franklin, Henry Adams, and Henry David Thoreau.\n\nHenry Louis Mencken had a long and friendly relationship with the Enoch Pratt Free Library. As a child, he frequented the neighborhood branch at Hollins and Calhoun Street. As an adult, he made frequent use of the vast resources of the Central Library in downtown Baltimore. He began to donate material to the library during his lifetime, and this continued after his death on January 29, 1956. The Mencken Room was opened on April 17, 1956, under the curatorship of Betty Adler. She was the Mencken bibliographer and the founding editor of the quarterly Menckeniana, which was first published by the library in 1962. All who have written about Mencken are very much in her debt.","id":"4ebd6a803eae5900060002b5","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81670","name":"H. L.

They fill the void over the ten years Excerpts from Hagerstown City Directory between United States censuses. \n\nThe first City Directory for Hagerstown, Maryland was published by John Randall in 1893. Earlier (1884-85) a combined directory for Hagerstown and its neighbor to the north, Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, was printed. The 1893 directory listed adults alphabetically but did not group family members together as would be done today. Only by checking the addresses can spouse or other persons living in the same residence be found. For example there are thirteen persons with the surname Feigley listed. By scanning the addresses James E. and Margaret Feigley can be seen to live in the same residence, 108 E Antietam. The 1893 edition also lists the occupation of the residents, allowing the researcher to find occupations such as sawyer, lamp lighter, founder, silk weaver, brick molder, oyster, spoke turner, cigar box maker and call boy. In addition, it lists \"coloreds\", abbreviated as \"col\".\n\nThe 1893 directory is for the city of Hagerstown only. It was not until 1908 that the first county directory was published. Also of interest in this directory is the list of classified businesses and a directory of patrons.\n\nThe details of the 1890 United States census were destroyed in a fire, making this 1893 listing of residents even more valuable. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the total population of Hagerstown in 1890 as 10,118.","id":"4ebd6a813eae5900060002b6","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81671","name":"Hagerstown City Directory 1893 - Washington County Public Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=4842","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z","id":"4ebddc9daede640006000544","profile_id":"4ebd6a813eae5900060002b6","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:03Z","description":"The Hale Zukas Papers, 1971-1998, consist of materials reflecting Zukas's leading role as a founder and activist for the disability rights and independent living movements.

He realized that in painting, unlike in nature, cause and effect are reversed: on canvas, color creates light. Hofmann wrote, \"Every color emanates a very characteristic light,\" and the special luminosity and radiance of his paintings are proof of his claim.\n\nAlong with other painters of his generation, Hofmann moved from representational and narrative paintings towards abstraction, where the basic elements of a picture-space, line, color, light, scale, shape, and texture-assert themselves as the primary aspects of a work. Abstraction does not mean, however, the disavowal of the human touch. In our culture, almost everything around us, visual imagery included, is produced by technologies that do not require human intervention. Painting (and sculpture) are the last handmade objects, and Hofmann makes certain that we are aware of this in his art. He is truly Homo Faber, Man the Maker, composing and controlling what we see and letting us know how he has made it. He creates agitated textures and vibrating surfaces by poking and prodding the pigment, making the paint ooze, and sometimes caressing the surface lightly with a loaded brush. Whether Hofmann splashes paint onto the canvas, or brushes it in heavy impasto, he turns the surface into a seemingly living witness to his manipulation of paint. -- Peter Selz, Professor Emeritus, University of California at Berkeley","id":"4ebd68ba3eae590006000056","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2546","name":"Hans Hofmann Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:50Z","url":"http://findaid.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf2n39n563","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:37Z","id":"4ebddb01aede640006000095","profile_id":"4ebd68ba3eae590006000056","text":"User-Agent: *\nAllow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:37Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:23:14Z","description":"Over 20,000 immigrants are currently being detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

The 39 photographs presented here are a selection from her negatives taken during the Free Speech Movement in the Fall of 1964.\n\nNestor's prolific career is all the more remarkable in that she is seriously disabled. Like Dorothea Lange (with whom she was acquainted), Nestor was afflicted with polio; unlike her more famous colleague, she could not walk without the assistance of crutches and, eventually, a wheelchair. Despite this she produced compelling work in often threatening situations. Born in 1924, Nestor earned a B.S. degree in public health at U.C. Berkeley before being stricken with polio in 1951. She studied photography in the early 1960s with Ansel Adams, Morley Baer, Minor White, and Dorothea Lange - her spiritual mentor.\n\nNestor's work appeared in Ramparts magazine as well as in several monographs including Equal Start (1968), On the Go (1968), The Trouble in Berkeley (1965) and Field Trips (1966). In the 1970s she became increasingly interested in changing family constellations, creating a series entitled Non-Traditional American Families, which exhibited in several galleries including the Focus Gallery in San Francisco. In 1988 she rephotographed these families for a book titled Family Portraits in Changing Times (1992).\n\nNestor has also photographed the disabled, focusing on disabled working women and artists. She has mounted ten solo exhibitions and participated in numerous group showings.","id":"4ebd68ad3eae590006000044","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2528","name":"Helen Nestor Free Speech Movement Photographs","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:46Z","url":"http://findaid.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf400003dx","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:23Z","id":"4ebddaf3aede640006000071","profile_id":"4ebd68ad3eae590006000044","text":"User-Agent: *\nAllow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:23Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:41Z","description":"The Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics is a consortium of institutions, artists, and scholars dedicated to exploring the relationship between expressive behavior (broadly construed as performance) and social and political life in the Americas.

What began as a sideline to the petroleum industry in 1930 soon developed into a thriving commercial concern. Higgins specialized in shallow-draft boats suitable to the bayous of Louisiana. With World War II that reputation enabled Higgins Industries to become one of the largest manufacturers of U. S. naval combat boats during World War II. The ability of the company to design and produce vessels in record time meant that during the war they produced 20,094 boats, employing 20,000 workers at seven plants in the New Orleans area. Their most famous vehicles were the landing craft used during the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, which prompted General Eisenhower to remark that Andrew Higgins \"won the war for us.\"\n\nThe diagrams in this collection are of Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB), better known as PT boats, which formed a major part of the company's war effort. From 1939-1945 the U. S. Navy purchased or contracted for 808 of these boats, generally in squadron-sized groups of twelve. Of these, Higgins Industries built or contracted to deliver 221: Nos. 5-6, 70, and 564 (Hellcat) were prototypes; 71-94; 197-254; 265-313; 450-485; 625-660; and 791-802 were series, or \"classes\" of contracts. The contracts for Nos. 797-808 were cancelled in the latter half of 1945 and these boats were never completed.

The recordings included in the Archive of Folk Culture collection were made in Alamosa, Manassa, and Antonito, Colorado, and in Cerro and Arroyo Hondo, New Mexico. In addition to these recordings, the collection includes manuscript materials and publications authored by Rael which provide insight into the rich musical heritage and cultural traditions of this region.

The collections document achievements in architecture, engineering, and landscape design in the United States and its territories through a comprehensive range of building types, engineering technologies, and landscapes, including examples as diverse as the Pueblo of Acoma, houses, windmills, one-room schools, the Golden Gate Bridge, and buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Administered since 1933 through cooperative agreements with the National Park Service, the Library of Congress, and the private sector, ongoing programs of the National Park Service have recorded America's built environment in multiformat surveys comprising more than 556,900 measured drawings, large-format photographs, and written histories for more than 38,600 historic structures and sites dating from Pre-Columbian times to the twentieth century. This online presentation of the HABS/HAER/HALS collections includes digitized images of measured drawings, black-and-white photographs, color transparencies, photo captions, written history pages, and supplemental materials. Since the National Park Service's HABS, HAER and HALS programs create new documentation each year, documentation will continue to be added to the online collections.

Of note are the guidebooks which contain not only house histories written by Samuel Gaillard Stoney, Jr., accompanied by photographs by numerous Charleston photographers, but also information about Historic Charleston Foundation and its activities, essays, maps, and advertisements for a variety of local businesses.","id":"4ebd6b4a3eae590006000309","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81800","name":"Historic Charleston Foundation Tours of Homes","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:55Z","url":"http://lowcountrydigital.library.cofc.edu/cdm4/browse.php?CISOROOT=%2FFAR","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:50Z","id":"4ebddcb2aede6400060005d8","profile_id":"4ebd6b4a3eae590006000309","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:50Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:16Z","description":"This collection represents South 1st Avenue, now 58th Drive and Glendale Avenue, from around 1910 to 1950.

The photographs document McNeese, Lake Charles, and the Imperial Calcasieu region from the early 1890s to the present.\n\nOf particular note are the photographs Maude Reid collected. Miss Reid was the first public health nurse in Calcasieu Parish and established several free clinics for the poor. In addition to her work in public health, Reid served as the unofficial historian of Lake Charles, collecting photographs, postcards, pamphlets, and clippings into scrapbooks. Today her materials give researchers insight into daily life in Lake Charles in the early 1900s.\n\nPhotographs in the collection also document major events in the area's history, including the Great Fire of 1910, the 1918 Hurricane, Prohibition rallies, and Hurricane Audrey. Other photographs follow the history of McNeese State University, from its inception in 1939 to the present.

Also included are World War II photographs of the 10th Mountain Division, ski troops based in Colorado who saw action in Italy.","id":"4ebd6b963eae5900060003bb","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82123","name":"History of the American West, 1860-1920: Photographs from the Collection of the Denver Public Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:59Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award97/codhtml/hawphome.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:42Z","id":"4ebddce6aede640006000727","profile_id":"4ebd6b963eae5900060003bb","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:42Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Physical Education","Religion","Science","Social Studies","Vocational Education"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:38Z","description":"The initial goal of The HistoryMakers is to complete 5,000 interviews of both well-known and unsung African American HistoryMakers within the next five years, creating an archive of unparalleled importance and exposing the archival collection to the widest audience possible.

Hotchkiss made detailed battle maps primarily of the Shenandoah Valley, some of which were used by the Generals Robert E.

The attractions included cattle, horses, and sheep venues, among displays of reapers, mowers, farming tools, and a variety of corn planters. On the third day, over 15,000 people attended. The fair was a success, netting $853 in profits with $1500 in premiums paid out to prize-winning exhibits. There were a total of 765 entries in all areas. For the next 40 years, the Illinois State Fair was hosted by twelve different cities including Freeport, Chicago, Alton and Olney. It settled permanently in Springfield in 1894. During World War II, from 1941 to 1945, no fairs were held. During this time the fairgrounds were used as a supply base for the Army Air Force. After the war, the major agricultural fairs in the United States underwent a subtle transition. At that time agriculture became more mechanized, more efficient, with bigger farms and greater production per acre while the size of the rural population was shrinking and the rural youth migrating to urban centers. Major fairs, Illinois included, began increasing exhibits on modern living, on industry and labor, on education and entertainment for the general public. In 1965 the Illinois Legislature passed an act creating the Illinois State Fair Agency. The main purpose of the Agency remained what had been the goal of the Fair throughout its history: to promote improved methods of agriculture, encourage increased yields and the raising of improved breeds of livestock, and to acquaint farmers with the latest implements and machinery. The Fair was also charged with exhibiting and promoting the activities of Illinois in the fields of industry, labor and education.","id":"4ebd6bc33eae590006000444","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82387","name":"Illinois State Fair Museum","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:31Z","url":"http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/isf","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:32Z","id":"4ebddd18aede64000600081c","profile_id":"4ebd6bc33eae590006000444","text":"User-agent: *\r\nAllow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:32Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":[],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:20Z","description":"This collection includes digitized books in numerous subject areas, some of which contain searchable full-text.","id":"4ebd69083eae5900060000a0","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2759","name":"Illinois State Library - General Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:44:02Z","url":"http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/isl","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:25Z","id":"4ebddb31aede640006000119","profile_id":"4ebd69083eae5900060000a0","text":"User-agent: *\r\nAllow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:25Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:59Z","description":"Illinois State University History is a growing collection that currently includes campus history books, proceedings of the first university governing board, photographs, campus history videos, and presidential letters.

These two tribes comprise most of the native population near here, but Winslow became a second home to a contingent of Laguna Indians and members of various other tribes. The Navajos are known as weavers and silversmiths, the Hopis as basket makers, kachina carvers, and for the storied ceremonies the latter represents. Both tribes have survived in a land and climate that can be inhospitable and formidable at best. For well over one hundred years their works have been prized collections and are representations of ancient cultures still embedded in the hearts, hands and traditions of artisans of today.\n\nThe Laguna Indians are one of the Pueblo Tribes of New Mexico and are known for their artistry in pottery and jewelry making. In the early 20th century some moved to Winslow, among other places along the rail route, to work with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. A close knit group, most lived in a settlement comprised of about fifty converted boxcars called the Laguna Colony.\n\nOne of the offshoots of the Lagunas in Winslow was the formation of the Santa Fe Indian Band, which at times contained members from as many as twelve tribes. With both concert and marching bands as well as a hoop and fancy dancing group, the members logged many miles performing at dedications and parades, including the Rose Bowl and President Dwight Eisenhower's inaugural parade in 1953.\n\nBy comparison, the span of years the various tribes have inhabited the area makes the town of Winslow founded in 1880, look like a relative newcomer. No matter what the tribe, the Indigenous Peoples are an intrinsic element of the Southwest and Winslow.","id":"4ebd6a313eae590006000220","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81477","name":"Indigenous Peoples Near Winslow","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:26Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/otmind","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:13Z","id":"4ebddc51aede640006000420","profile_id":"4ebd6a313eae590006000220","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:13Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:30:17Z","description":"This wiki contains Inland Riverboat photographs scanned from the rare books collection of The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County.","id":"4ebd69b93eae59000600018a","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81258","name":"Inland Riverboats Photograph Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:44:53Z","url":"http://wiki.cincinnatilibrary.org/index.php/Inland_Riverboats_Photograph_Collection","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:55Z","id":"4ebddbc7aede6400060002fd","profile_id":"4ebd69b93eae59000600018a","text":"User-agent: * \r\nDisallow: /bin/\r\nDisallow: /config/\r\nDisallow: /extensions/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /includes/\r\nDisallow: /languages/\r\nDisallow: /locale/\r\nDisallow: /maintenance/\r\nDisallow: /math/\r\nDisallow: /serialized/\r\nDisallow: /skins/\r\nDisallow: /t/\r\nDisallow: /tests/\r\nDisallow: /wordpress/\r\n\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:55Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies","Vocational Education"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:15Z","description":"The Westinghouse Works Collection contains 21 actuality films showing various views of Westinghouse companies.

They document the life of the man who came to be known as the \"Father of the Constitution\" through correspondence, personal notes, drafts of letters and legislation, an autobiography, legal and financial documents, and miscellaneous manuscripts. The collection is organized into six series dating from 1723 to 1836. Beginning with a selection of his father's letters, the series moves through Madison's years as a student, and as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and include extensive notes of the debates during his three-year term in the Continental Congress (1779-82). Notes and a memoranda document Madison's pivotal role in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the Virginia ratification convention of 1788. Other materials reflect the nine years that Madison spent in the House of Representatives and his tenure as Secretary of State during Thomas Jefferson's presidency.

Also part of the database are photographs of Brown's comrades-in-arms, other associates, various sites in the United States and Canada with which Brown or members of his family were connected. The latter include views of Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Brown's homestead at North Elba, New York. This database also contains over 100 original John Brown letters and manuscripts, a similar number of family letters, and three books of business letters from Brown's partnership with Simon Perkins in the wool trade. There are several hundred letters of Brown's associates and biographers as well. Prominent among the correspondents are George Luther Stearns and Frank Sanborn, both members of Brown's \"Secret Six,\" the group of New England abolitionists who supported Brown's foray into Virginia in 1859.

Consisting of 250,000 stereoscopic glass-plate and film negatives and 100,000 vintage prints, UCR-California Museum of Photography's Keystone-Mast Collection is the archive of the Keystone View Company of Meadville, PA (active from 1892-1963). As a collection, it is the world's largest body of original stereoscopic negatives and prints providing an encyclopedic view of global cultural history. Formed over the period of the United States' emergence as a world power, Keystone-Mast not only chronicles an age, it also represents in pictures a dominant point of view about the world during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is an important tool for among others, anthropologists, art historians, cultural studies scholars, historians, political scientists and sociologists.\n\nThe Keystone-Mast Collection Guide 2003 provides online access to approximately twenty percent of the total stereographic collection. To date, it represents content from the following geopolitical subject areas: entries from North America, from Central America, from West Indies (Caribbean Islands), from South America, from Oceania, from Asia, from Africa, and from the Middle East. When finished, the collection guide will consist of well over 100,000 online stereoviews complete with metadata.","id":"4ebd68b23eae59000600004c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2536","name":"Keystone-Mast Collection, 1870-1963","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:48Z","url":"http://findaid.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft1q2n999m","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:29Z","id":"4ebddaf9aede640006000081","profile_id":"4ebd68b23eae59000600004c","text":"User-Agent: *\nAllow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:29Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Science"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:07Z","description":"Cornell Library will partner with Cornell's College of Engineering and the Museum of Science in Boston to research and develop the use of stereolithographic (\"3D printing\") technology to create working physical replicas of mechanical artifacts that can be exchanged electronically between the project partners and manipulated by museum visitors, students, and other users of the collection.

He pitched for the Baltimore Orioles, the Philadelphia Athletics and the Boston Red Sox. Grove won the first Most Valuable Player trophy awarded to an American League player by the Baseball Writers Association of America in 1931 and was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. Since the MVP trophy was the first awarded, the Hall of Fame requested it be included in their museum, but it is reported that Lefty said: \"The people of 'Coney can't see it if it is in Cooperstown. Beside I promised John Meyers that I'd give it to the school.\" John Meyers was the coach at Valley High School, and that is where the trophy remained for a number of years, until there was concern for its safety. With the building of the George's Creek Regional Library in Lonaconing in 2000, the George's Creek Promotion Council had found a secure location where the trophy could be preserved, protected and displayed. In the history room in the library, along with other items from the town's rich past, the Most Valuable Player trophy and other items from Grove's baseball history are on display.","id":"4ebd6a833eae5900060002b8","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81673","name":"Lefty Grove - George's Creek Library, Allegany County","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=286","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z","id":"4ebddc9daede640006000548","profile_id":"4ebd6a833eae5900060002b8","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:29Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:46Z","description":"The Special Correspondence Files of the Herbert Lehman Papers contain correspondence with nearly 1,000 individuals from 1864 through 1982.

These voyages were part of the French effort to 1) accurately remeasure the shape of the globe from north to south, 2) systematically determine accurate longitudes from astronomical observations associated with the opening of the Paris observatory in 1672, and 3) explore the world. Because of this scientific undertaking, Guillaume de L'Isle is known as the first modern cartographer, Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville is credited with facilitating European penetration of Africa and of North America through the Great Lakes, and Jacques Nicholas Bellin is associated with the first modern hydrographic surveys and sea-atlases of the world.

Perhaps the most significant and noteworthy of items being offered by The Historic New Orleans Collection are selected materials from the Pierre Clement Laussat Papers. Laussat served as Napolean's Prefect for the Colony of Louisiana. Most of the items, ranging in dates from 1769 to 1815 are specific documents and correspondence of the colonial prefect of Louisiana during the eventful years of 1803 and 1804. Adding additional insight to Louisiana's colonial period are artifacts from Tulane University's Favrot Papers. These two collections include artifacts that provide much information about Spanish administration of the colony and include copies of both Pinckney's Treaty and the controversial 1802 interdiction of the American right of deposit at the port of New Orleans. Among hundreds of French documents in the Laussat Papers, perhaps the most notable is the first consul's order directing the Prefect Laussat to transfer Louisiana to the United States. Also, from the THNOC manuscript collections, several \"original\" newspaper articles have been selected as items for careful study and analysis. These original, rare and fragile newspapers follow the Louisiana Purchase story from rumor to reality.\nAlso included in the Louisiana Purchase and Louisiana Colonial History Collection are visual images provided by the Historic New Orleans Collection and the Louisiana State Archives that bring to life the people and places described in Laussat's personal memoirs. Tulane University's Favrot Family Papers provide first-hand accounts of Louisiana's Spanish and French colonial administrations. Detailing events from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, these papers provide information concerning the Saint Domingue revolt, slavery in colonial Louisiana and the interaction between colonial administrators and Native Americans. Recognizing the interrelationship of history and geography, the Louisiana Purchase document collection is enhanced by rare and original historical maps provided by the Louisiana State Archives, the Louisiana State Museum and The Historic New Orleans Collection.\nText documents selected provide interesting perspectives and historic details from the political debates related to the Purchase, both national and international in origination and scope. Also, an important 1803 broadside issued by President Jefferson calls upon Congress to come together to discuss the \"great and weighty matters\" on the prospective acquisition of the Louisiana Territory.","id":"4ebd69f63eae5900060001c7","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81380","name":"Louisiana Purchase and Louisiana Colonial History Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:10Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_LPC.php?CISOROOT=/LPC","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:46Z","id":"4ebddbfaaede64000600036f","profile_id":"4ebd69f63eae5900060001c7","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:37:46Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Science","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:31:14Z","description":"The LSU Cartographic Information Center currently holds 107,000 aerial photographs of Louisiana taken between 1939 and 1987.

The first group of images in this collection is the Museum's Collection of Daguerreotypes. Invented by French artists Louis Daguerre and Nicephore Niepce in 1839, the daguerreotype process was the first reliable and stable means of capturing a photographic image. Daguerreotypes are unique, positive images created on metal plates coated with silver. The plate sensitized with iodine vapor, placed in a camera and exposed to light for up to twenty minutes, developed through exposure to heated mercury vapor, and fixed by washing with a solution of salt or sodium hyposulphite. Because the surface is fragile, daguerreotypes are generally sealed in cases which can be quite elaborate. Daguerreotypes gradually fell out of fashion beginning in the early 1860s with the introduction of the cheaper, less labor intensive tintype. The wet collodion process, which had the distinct advantages of allowing unlimited reproductions from a negative and a much shorter exposure time, replaced both the daguerreotype and tintype following the Civil War. The Louisiana State Museum's collection includes 108 daguerreotypes dating from the early 1840s through the 1860s. Important holdings include a circa 1850 portrait of Myra Clark Gaines by Jesse Harrison Whitehurst; the earliest view of Canal Street, dating from about 1845, by Ezekial C. Hawkins; several early portraits by John Hawley Clarke; a group of Confederate soldiers made by Felix Moissenet; a portrait of the Baronness Pontalba; and portrait of African-American musician taken circa 1855.","id":"4ebd6a013eae5900060001cf","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81388","name":"Louisiana State Museum Photography Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:12Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_LSM_MPC.php?CISOROOT=/LSM_MPC","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:00Z","id":"4ebddc08aede64000600037f","profile_id":"4ebd6a013eae5900060001cf","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:00Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:31:29Z","description":"In the late 1930s, an unidentified photographer connected to the Louisiana State Museum took approximately 320 photographs of historic buildings in the French Quarter.

Its peak population was 10,121, and the majority of its internees came from pre-World War II Japanese American communities in the Los Angeles basin. The collection consists of files collected and maintained by Ralph Palmer Merritt (Director of the Japanese Relocation Center at Manzanar, California) including files of the Wartime Civil Control Administration (WCCA), the War Relocation Authority (WRA) records and correspondence from April 1942-December 1945, a history of the Manzanar Center (5 volumes), daily records of the Block Managers, Ralph Merritt's office files, and a two volume index of all evacuees at Manzanar. There are also books, clippings, copies of the Congressional Record, reprints of committee hearings, and magazines documenting the history of Japanese and Japanese Americans in the United States and their internment and military service, photographs and photographic negatives documenting activities and people at Manzanar, and approximately 170 photographs by Ansel Adams of the Manzanar War Relocation Center on 14 x 18 inch mats.

The southernmost boundary was primarily water bound by the Potomac River and crossed over the Chesapeake Bay to the Eastern Shore just south of Watkins Point, leaving the lower tip of the Shore in Virginia. The westernmost boundary of Maryland dropped in a perpendicular line from the fortieth parallel to the mouth of the Potomac River. The easternmost boundary dropped from the fortieth parallel along the tributary that feeds into the Delaware Bay and along the coast at the Atlantic Ocean including land that is now part of Delaware.\n\nLike so many cells dividing, Maryland's seven original counties (St. Mary's, Kent, Anne Arundel, Calvert, Charles, Talbot, and Somerset), over the state's 370-year history, have evolved  into 23 counties and the City of Baltimore.

With this act the Assembly circumvented British Law, abandoning the British sterling as its sole source of monetary exchange and establishing a new unit of monetary exchange for its citizens.\n\nThe first dollar notes were printed in 1767 by an Annapolis printer, Jonas Green, and included engravings by a local silversmith, Thomas Sparrow. When Green died later that year, his wife and three sons took over the business and continued as Maryland's official printers.\n\nCounterfeiting of colonial currency was a problem. To combat counterfeiting, printers embedded \"secret marks\" in the printed text and borders and used nature motifs. This latter technique, devised by Benjamin Franklin, was known as leaf or nature printing.\n\nMaryland's dollar held its value until the American Revolutionary War. Thereafter, its value decreased until by 1780 it was virtually worthless.","id":"4ebd6a843eae5900060002ba","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81675","name":"Maryland Colonial Currency - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=26056","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z","id":"4ebddc9eaede64000600054c","profile_id":"4ebd6a843eae5900060002ba","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:39:58Z","description":"Postcards have always been a way to send a message to friends and family. The precursors of postcards were pictures on envelopes. The first postcard, suggested by Dr. Emanuel Herrmann (1839-1902), an Austrian professor of economics, was approved by the Austro-Hungarian governments in 1869. In the United States, the first postcard is considered to be the exposition card issued in 1873, showing the main building of the Inter-State Industrial Exposition in Chicago. The first American postcards intended as souvenirs were those released in 1893 to commemorate the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. From then on, postcards became a very popular and inexpensive way of mass communication around the world. In 1907, a new postcard regulation brought a major change in postcard design. It allowed the back of postcards to be divided down the center. The right side of the back was now for the address and postage, and the left side was for the personal message that used to be written on the front of the card. Until 1915, a majority of U.S. postcards were printed in Europe, especially in Germany whose printing methods were regarded as the best in the world. When World War I broke out, American postcard publishers stopped using the German printers for obvious reasons.In Maryland, postcard sending caught on early. After the turn of the 20th century, thousands of visitors sent postcards to their family members and friends around the state and the country. Postcard collecting became a national hobby during the years 1900-1920.

Gila Pueblo, as it later became known, was one of the earliest Arizona institutions doing archaeological surveying and research in the Southwest. It was founded by Winifred and Harold S. Gladwin as a private foundation and employed professional archaeologists whose research was published in the Medallion Papers. Their work was instrumental in defining the Hohokam, Mogollon, San Simon and Cochise cultures and in describing early pottery types including Hohokam red-on-buff, Salado polychrome, Casas Grandes and others.\n\nGila Pueblo was located in east-central Arizona, several miles south of Globe, Arizona. It was in operation until 1950, at which time, the Foundation was dissolved. The buildings were acquired by the National Park Service and became the Southwest Archaeological Center from 1950 to 1971. They are now occupied by the Gila Community College (formally the Globe Campus/Eastern Arizona College). The Foundation's artifacts, photographs, library and documents were donated to the Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona.\n\nDistinguished archaeologists published in the Medallion Papers are: Charles Avery Amsden, Ernst Antevs, Alice M. Brues, Nora Gladwin, Winifred and Harold Gladwin, Emil W. Haury, Fred Hawley, M. M. Leighton, Deric O'Bryan, E. B. Sayles, George C. Vaillant, and George and Edna Woodbury.\n\nThe Medallion Papers are digitally presented here in their full-text. The original issues Nos. 1-3 carry the imprint \"Privately printed for the Medallion, Pasadena, California,\" while issues Nos. 4-39 have the imprint \"Gila Pueblo, Globe, Arizona.\" The earliest issues were not published with authors or numbering and it wasn't until they became more widely distributed that stick-on labels were prepared with this information. All print work was done by Lancaster Press, Inc., Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Each volume was beautifully crafted on heavy cream-colored paper stock and most issues included color plates and line art. Covers displayed a design taken from a Querino polychrome bowl as the Medallion Papers colophon. The original format was 6 5/8 by 9 3/ 4 inches until issue No. 25, at which time the format changed to 8 1/2 by 11 1/8 inches. Issue No. 25, Excavations at Snaketown: Material Culture, which was originally printed in 1937, was later reprinted in 1965 by the University of Arizona Press, which retains its distribution rights.\n\nAlso presented here are the Amsden Pottery Paintings, a collection of 18 oil paintings commissioned by the Gila Pueblo Archaeological Foundation for use as illustrations in the Medallion Papers. The paintings were executed by Theodore (\"Ted\") Price Amsden between 1929 and 1936. The images of the paintings are presented in the order in which they appear in the Medallion Papers.","id":"4ebd6a323eae590006000222","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81479","name":"Medallion Papers","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:27Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/medallion","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:15Z","id":"4ebddc53aede640006000424","profile_id":"4ebd6a323eae590006000222","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:15Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Health","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:00Z","description":"A collection of colorful illustrations satirizing both doctor and patient, illness and treatment.

Millspaugh graduated from St. Mary's Academy in 1917, and completed undergraduate work at Vanderbilt and Springhill College before earning a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from Loyola University in New Orleans. Following this event, he completed his graduate degree in pharmacy from Tulane University. Soon after, Millspaugh began his lifelong career in pharmacy in Natchitoches. He married Ella Charleville Millspaugh on July 29, 1925 in Natchitoches, and had two children: Lelia (Betty) Millspaugh Horton, an d Giles Weedon Millspaugh III. Millspaugh also had five grandchildren.\n\nAn avid stamp and photograph collector, Millspaugh's collection numbered in the hundreds. Many of the photographs he received were given to him by tourists, residents, friends and acquaintances, and were displayed in his drug store for over 25 years. Millspaugh was a member of the Louisiana State Board of Pharmacy and owner and operator of Millspaugh's Drug Store in Natchitoches until his death in 1976.\n\nIncluded in the collection are 127 photographs assembled by Giles Millspaugh. These photographs reflect his interest in the history of Natchitoches Parish and the city of Natchitoches. Although nearly all of the photographs are labeled, the bulk of them are not dated. These photographs offer a rare glimpse into the everyday life, growth and change of Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana and the city of Natchitoches, Louisiana.

The plats were created during the first government land survey of the state conducted by the U.S. Surveyor General's Office during the years 1848-1907. The survey was conducted in anticipation of subdividing the land and selling it to settlers moving into the area. The plats made it easier to locate and legally describe the parcels being purchased. This collection of more than 3,600 maps also includes later General Land Office (GLO) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) maps up to the year 2001. Minnesota's survey plat maps serve as the fundamental legal records for real estate in the state; all property titles and descriptions stem from them. They also serve as an essential resource for surveyors and as a rich source of information about the state's physical geography prior to European settlement. Finally, they serve as a testimony to years and years of hard work by the surveying community, often under challenging conditions. Plat Books and Atlases: The Minnesota Historical Society's 1,350 county atlases and plat books showing land ownership comprise the largest part of the atlas collection.

In 1964, organizations such as the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Students for Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) recruited college students from across the United States to travel to Mississippi, shining a national spotlight on conditions there while registering voters, building community centers, and teaching at \"freedom schools\" in that state. Before going to Mississippi, the students trained at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio for three weeks. The campus of Western College is now a part of Miami University.

From newspaper articles, to government reports, to novels, to plays, and even to films, the massacre has been represented in popular culture and public discourse in ways that reflect the historical context of the writers and the meanings they derived from the events of September 11, 1857.\n\nRather than delving into the facts surrounding the massacre, this archive focuses on these portrayals of the Mountain Meadows Massacre and how their creators represented the event and its aftermath. Additionally, this archive gives users tools to explore these representations. With these tools, which include advanced browsing functions, concept highlighting that reveals narrative elements within texts, and visualizations that illustrate language usage and information dissemination, visitors can begin to develop their own understanding of the ways the massacre was reported on, ignored, contextualized, and reinterpreted over time. \n\nThis archive contains newspaper account of the event, government investigation reports, early Mountain Meadows Massacre histories in works of Western Americana, Apostate and Anti-Mormon publications, as well as works of fiction, drama, and film. By creating machine-readable electronic texts and digital objects, this collection of core documents can be searched and browsed by users, providing not only increased access to key sources, but also potential for the emergence of previously unforeseen research questions.","id":"4ebd6a4b3eae59000600025f","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81542","name":"Mountain Meadows Massacre in Public Discourse","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:52:32Z","url":"http://mountainmeadows.unl.edu/","achievements":{}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:21Z","description":"The Mujeres Latinas Project of the Iowa Women's Archives seeks to collect and preserve materials which document the lives and contributions of Latinas and their families to Iowa history.

The NAHC documents the history and development of the automobile and other forms of motorized, wheeled, land transportation in the United States and abroad.Since the late nineteenth century, the Detroit Public Library has aggressively collected automotive print materials such as books, periodicals, advertising literature, photographs, specifications, service and owner's manuals, and personal and business papers. In recognition of this effort, the library established the NAHC as a collection in 1953. The NAHC contains resources of over 600,000 processed items. Thousands of photographs which depict the automobile's historical, social, mechanical, and design aspects are available for public viewing, research, and publication. Automobile manuscript files contain more than 350,000 technical and descriptive items that illuminate the styling detail, specifications, and restoration of the automobile. Biographical files, personal papers, and business documents of both pioneers and corporate leaders offer insight into the development, industrial psychology, and economics of the automotive industry. Rich in automotive fact and lore, international in scope, customers will agree that the NAHC offers unsurpassed resources and reference services.","id":"4ebd6b733eae590006000358","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82005","name":"National Automotive History Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:50:11Z","url":"http://mmm.lib.msu.edu/search/browsecollections.cfm?t=2&col=48","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:24Z","id":"4ebddcd4aede640006000666","profile_id":"4ebd6b733eae590006000358","text":"# ROBOTS.TXT\n# Rwhw 20 June 2002\n# Disallow all robots\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /\n\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:24Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:46Z","description":"The McLean County Museum of History offers access to a wide range of Native American objects.

Continuing on a prehistoric note is the large Mary Clark Collection of Anasazi pottery and implements, excavated in the early 1900's.\n\nAn exhibit of Mormon colonization of the Little Colorado River specific to Winslow dates to the late 1870's. The first colonists arrived from Utah in 1876, and built a 200 foot square fort that same year. All that remains today is the foundation, but our museum houses primitive tools found at the Brigham City Fort site, a scale model of the fort, and archives from descendants of those pioneers.\n\nWinslow was basically a railroad town, with the first train making its way through in 1881. In connection with the railroad came a Harvey House, which brought many ladies to the West for employment and travel opportunities. Ranching, trading posts, Route 66 and the Lindbergh designed airport also are also key factors in the development of Winslow.

Read the grant application abstract and narrative for further information about the project.  The virtual museum will be organized as a series of exhibits, each representing a different aspect of the culture and history of the region. A variety of different formats (text, photographs, video, and audio) will be used as appropriate for each specific exhibition being developed.  Community Museum online exhibits will include: the Hoh and Quileute tribal cultures; the Spoelstra collection of Americana; timber history; the lives of early pioneers; and the cultures of the growing Hispanic population.  A community-based approach will be used to collect images and to curate them. Local community members will be involved in identifying and photographing images, videotaping events and collecting oral histories.  Technology such as digital and film cameras, digital camcorders, lighting kits, and scanners will reside within the communities with appropriate on-going training directed toward digitization, documentation, and collections management. CONTENTdm Software, developed at the UW by the Center for Information Systems Optimization (CISO), will serve as the collections management technology.

Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and Andrew Young appear in this collection along with Lester Maddox, George Wallace, and Jesse Helms.\n\nSouthern Women: These interviews reflect the influence of women in science, medicine, education, law, politics, activism, as well as in factories, where a significant portion of the workforce was and is made up of women.","id":"4ebd68fb3eae59000600008c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2730","name":"Oral Histories of the American South","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:59Z","url":"http://docsouth.unc.edu/sohp/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:14Z","id":"4ebddb26aede6400060000f2","profile_id":"4ebd68fb3eae59000600008c","text":"# Robots.txt file created by http://www.webtoolcentral.com\n# For domain: http://docsouth.unc.edu\n\n# All robots will spider the domain\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: \n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:14Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Religion","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:23Z","description":"This audio collection consists of snippets from interviews with residents who lived in and around the White Mountains area.

Some of these images have become well known through use in text books and documentary film projects, but many have never been reproduced.

Known also as bird's-eye views, perspective maps, and aero views, panoramic maps are nonphotographic representations of cities portrayed as if viewed from above at an oblique angle. Although not generally drawn to scale, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features in perspective. The majority of items presented here are documented in PANORAMIC MAPS of Cities in the United States and Canada, second edition (1984), by John R. H\u00e9bert and Patrick E. Dempsey. H\u00e9bert and Dempsey compiled a checklist of 1,726 panoramic maps of U.S. and Canadian cities, the bulk of which were done by Albert Ruger, Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler, Lucien R. Burleigh, Henry Wellge, and Oakley H. Bailey who prepared more than fifty-five percent of the panoramic maps in the Library of Congress.

A cooperative effort between the National Library of Spain, the Biblioteca Colombina y Capitular of Seville and the Library of Congress, the project is part of the Library of Congress Global Gateway initiative to build digital library partnerships with national libraries around the world. Through the presentation in digital form of books, maps, prints and photographs, manuscripts, and other documents from the collections of the partner libraries, this project illuminates five main themes related to the history of Spain and the parallel histories between the United States and Spain: Exploration and Early Settlement, Colonization and Settlement, Meeting of Cultures and Religious/Evangelical Activities, American Revolution, and Mutual Perceptions. Exploration and Early Settlement was launched in June 2005; the other sections are in process.The Historias Paralelas project explores the comparative history of Spanish expansion into North America from Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas across the continent through Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and California all the way to Alaska, as well as the American expansion westward and the meeting of their frontiers.;The site features maps, rare books, manuscripts, prints and photographs, and motion pictures from the Library of Congress. These selected items relate to Spanish influence and interaction with other cultures existing in the geographic areas of North America, the Caribbean, and present-day Mexico between 1492-1898. Bilingual, English/Spanish access is provided throughout the site whenever possible. An interface with search and browse by Subjects, Titles, Geographic Locations features, supports navigation to 118 maps, two rare books, and one book from the United States Congressional Serial Set. In addition, links are offered to eight relevant American Memory collections and three Exhibitions from the Library of Congress. The American Memory format emphasizes direct access to primary source materials via specialized search and browse list tools for each collection. The Exhibitions format features a blend of historical context and images of historical treasures which have been displayed at the Library of Congress.","id":"4ebd691a3eae5900060000cf","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?70111260","name":"Parallel Histories: Spain, the United States, and the American Frontier","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:13Z","url":"http://international.loc.gov/intldl/eshtml/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:53Z","id":"4ebddb4daede640006000199","profile_id":"4ebd691a3eae5900060000cf","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:53Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:16Z","description":"Park Forest began in 1946 as a dream held by Carroll F.

Many of these cards showed images of buildings or street scenes in Philadelphia. These cards span a time period from the turn of the century to the 1980's.  After showing some of these cards to faculty, it was decided that this group of cards could be valuable as a teaching aid to students in the architectural and other design programs. At this point the cards were organized into a collection and areas of interest not include were identified for future acquisition. Fortunately with Ebay, large number of cards are constantly being made available at generally reasonable prices. So it is possible to add to the collection at a slow but steady pace. With an organized collection available and the need to make it accessible to the university community, a grant proposal was made to LSTA which was successful. This grant was used to pay students to scan the postcards and supply the descriptive data for each card. Besides making the image of the postcard available, designing the structure of the card description was necessary. In determining this organization it was decided that publishing information and sender information should be included. Many of the postcard images show the main image but they do not include an image of the reverse side. This makes it impossible to determine the publisher/printer of the image and hinders in determining the date of the card.  Also it was decided that on used postal cards, the comments by the sender and the address of the recipient could hold future scholarly interest. Because of this interest in documenting different publishers, cards have been included in the collection that have the same front image but have different publishers. Many locations have multiple cards included because of image variations and publishing differences.","id":"4ebd6b823eae590006000369","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82023","name":"Philadelphia & Environs: An Architectural History through

The Jewish News of Greater Phoenix is a privately owned weekly newspaper reporting on local, national and international stories of interest to the Jewish community of metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. The newspaper has been published continuously since 1948. The collection spans the six decades of the newspaper's existence with most of the material dating from the 1960's and onwards.\n\nThe photographs in the collection depict all aspects of Jewish life in Phoenix including religious celebrations, cultural and social events, and political and business figures. Pictures of special occasions such as weddings, graduations, and bar and bat mitzvahs are also part of the collection. Many of the photographs commemorate milestones such as newly built temples, Jewish Community Centers, the Valley's first Jewish day school, or the first meeting of the Jewish Women's Federation. There are also photographs of members of the community in many facets of everyday life. Together, the pictures document the evolution of a community; they offer a look at the changes, achievements, and progress of the Phoenix Jewish community over the years.\n\nFunding for this exhibit has been provided by a grant from the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater Phoenix.\n\nThe photos displayed as part of the Arizona Memory Project website represent a small sample of the much larger collection. In organizing this display we tried to represent a cross section of community life exhibiting as many different organizations and individuals as possible. Additionally, we aimed to present photographs from all of the decades within the collection. The photographs are organized by category: religious, cultural, social, political, business, youth, and weddings/bar and bat mitzvah.","id":"4ebd6a383eae59000600022f","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81492","name":"Phoenix Jewish News Photographs Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:28Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/ajhjnp","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:21Z","id":"4ebddc59aede64000600043e","profile_id":"4ebd6a383eae59000600022f","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:21Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:34:01Z","description":"This collection of 548 photographs comes from two albums of family photographs created by Conrad Munro Donner (1844-1916), a peripatetic engineer from the Hamburg-Altona area near the border between Denmark and Germany who had an active interest in photography.

Published primarily from the 1890s to 1910s, these prints were created by the Photoglob Company in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, and the Detroit Publishing Company in Michigan. The richly colored images look like photographs but are actually ink-based photolithographs, usually 6.5 x 9 inches. Like postcards, the photochroms feature subjects that appeal to travelers, including landscapes, architecture, street scenes, and daily life and culture. The prints were sold as souvenirs and often collected in albums or framed for display. The Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division assembled this collection from two sources that provided prints in mint condition. In 1985, the prints of Europe and the Middle East were purchased from the Galerie Muriset in Switzerland. In 2004, Howard L. Gottlieb generously donated the North American views.

They portray an entire dynasty of colonial proprietors, the barons of Baltimore, from the founder, who projected the Colony of Maryland, and his son, who in 1634 established the third English foothold in America, to the last Lord, whose death nearly a century and a half later closed the succession. These are the men who owned the soil of Maryland under a charter of feudal type that conveyed one of the most extensive grants of powers conceded by the crown of England during the period of colonization. One after the other, they controlled, in gradually lessening degree, the peopling, the economic development, and the government of Maryland for one hundred and thirty-seven years, save for two short interludes.\n\nThese pictures kindle a fresh interest in the history of our country&mdash;a varied panorama in which Maryland illustrates the evolution of an idea borrowed from the Middle Ages, cherished for a century and half by noble lords of an aristocratic regime, and transformed by the character and experience of its people into a republican society.\n\nFive of the portraits were presented to the Library in 1940 by Dr. Hugh Hampton Young of Baltimore, who succeeded at great pains in securing them in 1933, when he found that the series had been dispersed at auction in London. The portrait of the second Lord Baltimore had been purchased by Mr. William Randolph Hearst. Dr. Young informed the trustees of the Library that, if this portrait could be acquired by the institution, he would gladly present the other five. This generous promise was fulfilled in 1940, and thus this remarkable series of portraits of six successive generations was permanently reunited in the city that bears the name of the proprietary title.","id":"4ebd6a883eae5900060002be","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81679","name":"Portraits of the Six Lords Baltimore -

Butcher photographs and the letters of the Uriah W. Oblinger family. Together they illustrate the story of settlement on the Great Plains. Approximately 3,000 glass plate negatives crafted by Butcher record the process of settlement in Nebraska between 1886 and 1912. Butcher photographed actively in central Nebraska including Custer, Buffalo, Dawson and Cherry counties. The approximately 3,000 pages of Oblinger family letters discuss land, work, neighbors, crops, religious meetings, problems with grasshoppers, financial problems, and the Easter Blizzard of 1873. Uriah Oblinger came from Indiana to Fillmore County, Nebraska in 1873 to claim a homestead for his family. In the eloquent letters exchanged between Uriah and his wife Mattie, and in letters to other family members, Oblinger expresses very personal insight into the joy, despair, and determination in their struggle to establish a home on the prairie.","id":"4ebd6b9d3eae5900060003e1","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82163","name":"Prairie Settlement: Nebraska Photographs and Family Letters, 1862-1912","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:01Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/award98/nbhihtml/pshome.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:46Z","id":"4ebddceaaede640006000773","profile_id":"4ebd6b9d3eae5900060003e1","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:46Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:44Z","description":"The President's Collection is a three-volume set of vintage photographs of Baltimore streets and streetcars. It is believed that the photographs were taken at the request of the President of the United Railways & Electric (UR&E) Company to document some aspects of managing and maintaining streetcars in Baltimore. It features photographs taken by various photographers for the various UR&E departments including Claim, Engineering, Excursion, Motive Power, and Maintenance-of-Way.\n\nThe UR&E Company was responsible for the roadway between tracks and 18 inches on each side of the tracks, so some photographs in the collection appear to have been taken to show work in progress or work completed. It is thought that in some cases the photographs were used to document problems with road conditions that affected streetcar safety or movement but for which Baltimore City agencies such as the Sewerage Commission or Roads Commission were responsible.\n\nAlthough the UR&E functioned mainly as reliable transport for the citizens of Baltimore to and from work, it also provided weekend rail service to and from parks or recreational areas near the city. The President's Collection gives us a glimpse into early twentieth century Baltimore, often documenting its lost treasures, rising communities, and institutions still thriving today.\n\nThe Baltimore Streetcar Museum (BSM) located at 1905 Falls Road in Baltimore is a non-profit museum dedicated to preserving Baltimore's public transportation history, particularly as it relates to the street railway era. Visitors to the BSM can view one of the many historical exhibits and take unlimited rides on some of Baltimore's original streetcars. The BSM also houses one of the most extensive collections of streetcar or street-railroad memorabilia in its library, maintained in part by the Baltimore Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society.","id":"4ebd6a883eae5900060002bf","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81680","name":"President's Collection Photographs - Baltimore Streetcar Museum","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=12356","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z","id":"4ebddc9eaede640006000556","profile_id":"4ebd6a883eae5900060002bf","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:39Z","description":"The James Prigoff slide collection is an important visual resource that helps document the Chicano visual arts movement in California, and in particular, the San Diego and Tijuana area.

These materials are significant in their place within the fabric of American history and culture, but efforts to present these bindings in a collection that is representative of the era as a whole and to make them available virtually, via the World Wide Web have been limited.\n\nPBO, a significant digital collection of decorative bindings, along with a comprehensive glossary and guide to the elements of these objects, will strengthen the growing interest in and create broader awareness for this \"common\" object called the book.\n\nDecorative bindings cover many of the books that people have in their homes today, but their owners are often unaware of their cultural and historical significance. These bindings reflect not only social and cultural history, but bibliographic history as well.\n\nPBO expands awareness of the book as artifact and of the role decorative bindings play in providing a window into historical, cultural, and industrial period of 1815-1930. This project increases the awareness of the general public about the importance of publishers' bindings as reflections of historical events, art movements, and the evolution of commercial binderies.\n\nThe project will also afford students, teachers, binders, and scholars in many different areas the opportunity to study up to 5,000 decorative bindings from two different physical collections in a single, virtual location.\n\nOne can look upon this project as developing a model that other repositories can use with their own collections. PBO greatly broadens a relatively unexplored scholarly field.

The railroad was the first and most complex national system in American history. The records of this system's colossal growth are as diverse as they are voluminous, ranging from massive and detailed corporate records to editorials, cartoons, poetry, songs, and even abandoned track lines in today's landscape. While many histories have addressed the railroad's importance, we need a new approach that takes account of how the railroad triggered unexpected outcomes in American society and how the system became wedded into the fabric of modern America. Railroads and the Making of Modern America seeks to use the digital medium to investigate, represent, and analyze this social change and document episodes of the railroad's social consequence. \n\nAs a whole, this project aims to collect and make available a wide array of materials to shed light on the ways Americans experienced the railroads in the nineteenth century. The intent for this project is not to develop corporate histories of the railroads, which have been done very well elsewhere, but instead to capture and represent the social history of the railroad and its role in American history. These larger aims will guide the selection process of topics and materials.","id":"4ebd6a4b3eae59000600025d","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81540","name":"Railroads and the Making of Modern America","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:35Z","url":"http://railroads.unl.edu/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:49Z","id":"4ebddc75aede640006000497","profile_id":"4ebd6a4b3eae59000600025d","text":"User-agent: *\nAllow: /\n\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:49Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:32Z","description":"Collection consists of correspondence, speeches, manuscripts, articles, publications, and photographs related to the life and career of Ralph J.

Roosevelt, a lifelong sailor and former assistant secretary of the Navy, sent Winston Churchill a handwritten note, in which he included a quotation from an 1849 William Longfellow poem, \u201cThe Building of the Ship,\u201d which began \u201cSail On, O Ship of State!\u201d His use of a ship\u2019s metaphor to describe the battle then being waged between Great Britain and Germany, and to fortify the spirits of the British, reflects his fascination with the sea, but also suggests the degree to which Roosevelt saw himself as a captain of his own ship of state. It is no accident, therefore, that during his presidency, companies mass produced images of Roosevelt at the helm, steering the American state. Imposed on clocks and lamp bases, Roosevelt\u2019s image and figure reminded Americans that a strong leader would guide them through troubled seas. Artifacts such as the ones in this collection, located in the Joseph M. Jacobs and Lowery Collections of FDR memorabilia at the Roosevelt University Library, illustrate the extraordinary popularity of America\u2019s 32nd president.

George and his elder brother Robert Cruikshank (1789-1856) learned the craft of design, collaboration, and printmaking from their father, the noted caricaturist Isaac Cruikshank (1748-1811). George Cruikshank was also greatly influenced by predecessor William Hogarth (1697-1764) and early contemporaries Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827) and James Gillray (1757-1815).\n\nGeorge Cruikshank's lengthy career spanned the Regency period (1811-1820) and Victorian era (1837-1901). From age nine to eighty-five, Cruikshank produced thousands of designs in formats ranging from caricatural prints, book illustrations, lottery puffs, and song sheets. Cruikshank's early caricatures provided sharp commentary on British politics and culture. Favorite targets were Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821), King George IV (1762-1830), and dandies and trendsetters of the early nineteenth century. When interest in caricatural prints waned in England in the 1820s, Cruikshank shifted to designing and publishing humorous serials, such as \"My Sketch Book,\" and illustrating serialized novels by authors such as Charles Dickens (1812-1870) and William Harrison Ainsworth (1805-1882). In the last decades of his life, Cruikshank became deeply involved in the Temperance movement, producing images and text directly attributing difficult contemporary social issues--violence, poverty, crime--to the pernicious effects of alcohol.","id":"4ebd68bb3eae590006000057","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2547","name":"Richard Vogler Cruikshank Collection","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:51Z","url":"http://findaid.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/ft358004x0","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:38Z","id":"4ebddb02aede640006000097","profile_id":"4ebd68bb3eae590006000057","text":"User-Agent: *\nAllow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:38Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:30Z","description":"The RCPL Historical Collection is a selection of digital images of Harper\u2019s Weekly and Frank Leslie\u2019s Illustrated Weekly civil war lithographs that feature Columbia, S.C.","id":"4ebd6b6a3eae590006000343","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81918","name":"Richland County Public Library Historical Collections","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:46:21Z","url":"http://www.myrcpl.com/local-history/digital-collections-sc-digital-library","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:16Z","id":"4ebddcccaede640006000646","profile_id":"4ebd6b6a3eae590006000343","text":"# $Id$\n#\n# robots.txt\n#\n# This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts\n# of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo!\n# and Google.

His works from the Civil War are regarded not only as wonderful examples of artistry from the era but also as valuable historical resources detailing views as they actually appeared.\n\nAlthough Sachse created other bird's eye view maps, the five and one-half by twelve foot bird's eye view of 1869 Baltimore is his most ambitious work. He is reported to have said it took three years and three months for four artists to complete the map, first producing a detailed layout of the streets, then traveling around the city to draw the buildings. The map was issued in twelve separate pieces showing remarkable detail of the entire city, whose boundary at the time was Northern (now North) Avenue, and beyond.\n\nSachse map detail showing Pabst Brewery in CantonHe underwrote the cost of this ambitious project by selling advertising space along the map's border: 134 scenes of local businesses cover the outline, including 21 breweries! Purported to show every house in Baltimore, the map identifies many of the businesses and institutions that existed at the time.\n\nPhotographed, digitally reassembled, and enlarged, this map is now being shown as just one of the maps displayed at the Enoch Pratt Free Library as part of the exhibit entitled Mapping Maryland and the World: Historic Maps from the Pratt Collections.\n\nSachse map detail showing various buildings from Part 4The map depicts a bustling city, one of great commerce and industry in the post-war years. The drawings are almost all perfectly scaled and accurate. Sachse's own building is clearly seen at the intersection of Charles and Camden Streets. One interesting exception is City Hall shown in its completed state, when in actuality it was still under construction; note that in the map its front is facing south, although since its completion in 1875 its front has faced east!\n\nLegend has it that the cost of producing the map sent Sachse's company into bankruptcy; sales for a map that cost $15 were slow even to commercial customers. Today, fewer than ten complete copies of the original map are known to exist. This new digital version from the Maryland Department of the Central Library, Enoch Pratt Free Library / State Library Resource Center allows the viewer not only to see the exquisite detail of the original 12 parts but also to view and appreciate in composite form this monumental achievement in art and mapmaking!","id":"4ebd6a893eae5900060002c0","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81681","name":"Sachse's Bird's Eye View of City of Baltimore 1869 - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=20872","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z","id":"4ebddc9eaede640006000558","profile_id":"4ebd6a893eae5900060002c0","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:29:48Z","description":"The Sagebrush Vernacular website is an exhibition of 120 photographs of rural Nevada architecture.","id":"4ebd699c3eae59000600017c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81195","name":"Sagebrush Vernacular: Architecture of Rural Nevada","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:44:51Z","url":"http://www.knowledgecenter.unr.edu/specoll/photoweb/barns/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:36Z","id":"4ebddbb4aede6400060002e7","profile_id":"4ebd699c3eae59000600017c","text":"# allow robots access to site except for certain folders\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /_notes/\r\nDisallow: /bin/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /Templates/\r\n\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:36Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:25Z","description":"Sahuaro Ranch was one of the first farms in the Glendale area and a reminder of Glendale's agricultural beginnings.

The buildings in the photographs were located in present-day Hampton Park, and were temporary, made with wood frames covered with stucco and plaster mixed with jute. These buildings were destroyed after the Exposition. The remaining photographs of people, tombstones and cabins were taken in 1939 when Hyde, as chief cemetery investigator for the South Carolina Public Service Authority during the construction of Lake Moultrie, was charged with cataloging and researching the graves that were moved prior to the lake's creation.","id":"4ebd6adf3eae5900060002f7","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81761","name":"Samuel Lord Hyde Photographs","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:52Z","url":"http://lowcountrydigital.library.cofc.edu/collections/hyde/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:42Z","id":"4ebddcaaaede6400060005be","profile_id":"4ebd6adf3eae5900060002f7","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:42Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:28:08Z","description":"The Bancroft Library's holdings of The San Francisco News-Call Bulletin newspaper photograph archive consist almost entirely of original photographic negatives of San Francisco Bay Area news events taken by staff photographers between about 1915 and September 1965.

Sandusky County men formed substantial elements of the following Ohio regiments: 8th, 21st, 25th, 49th, 53rd, 55th, 57th, 67th, 72nd, 100th, 101st, 111th, and 186th as well as the 169th ONG and the 3rd, 9th, and 10th cavalry units. The county's largest single contribution of men was the 72nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry recruited by Fremont attorney and Ohio Congressman Ralph P. Buckland. By war's end, 65% of the county's military-age men saw service in the Civil War. Sandusky Countians, fought at Gettysburg, Shiloh, Bull Run, Winchester, Antietam, Atlanta, Chancellorsville, Stone's River, Fredericksburg, Nashville, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Franklin, Kennesaw Mountain, Resaca, and Brice's Cross Roads. They took part in the Siege of Vicksburg and the March to the Sea. Many suffered and died in Confederate prisons at Andersonville, Libby, Cahaba, Millen, and Macon. There were two Medal of Honor winners: John Miller of the 8th Ohio Volunteer Infantry at Gettysburg and Charles McCleary of the 72nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry at the Battle of Nashville. Major General James Birdseye McPherson of Clyde, Ohio, commander of the Army of the Tennessee, was the highest ranking Union officer killed in the Civil War. \nThis database was published by Sandusky County Kin Hunters in 1992 as a book: Sandusky County,Ohio Civil War Soldiers, which is no longer available from the organizations.

Bradford, Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman was published in 1869 and became the source of most of the stories about and, later, books on Tubman's life and deeds up to and during the American Civil War. The book was published at Tubman's request to help her raise money to support her elderly parents and pay the mortgage on the house she had bought for them in Auburn, New York. It consists of stories told by Tubman to Bradford about her life as a slave growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore, about her escape from slavery, about her life as a conductor on the Underground Railroad, and about her service to the U. S. Army during the Civil War. It includes letters testifying to her service, truthfulness, and honesty and a newspaper account of how she helped the runaway slave Charles Nalle to escape from custody before being returned to slavery. It also provides two other features: the Essay on Woman-Whipping, and the List of Subscribers to the Publishing Fund. The Essay is an antislavery tract about the practice, by both male and female owners, of whipping both male and female slaves. The List displays the names of friends and benefactors, most from Auburn, New York, who donated money to defray the cost of publication of the book.\n\nWritten and assembled in about a year by an author whose knowledge of the South, of slavery, and of her subject has been called into question, the book certainly doesn't meet the standards of evidence of historical research today. Indeed, in the revised edition published by Bradford in 1886 and entitled Harriet Tubman, The Moses of Her People, facts and descriptions were changed without explanation. Nevertheless, Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman presents a compelling picture of life in the South before and during the Civil War and of the courage and resourcefulness of Harriet Tubman's life in the face of slavery.","id":"4ebd6a8a3eae5900060002c1","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81682","name":"Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman - Eastern Shore Regional Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=12520","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z","id":"4ebddc9eaede64000600055a","profile_id":"4ebd6a8a3eae5900060002c1","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:37:29Z","description":"The School Insurance Photographs, ca. 1935-1952 series at the South Carolina Archives and History Center includes photographs made between ca. 1935 and 1952 of approximately 2,600 schools in South Carolina.

The discoveries of the New World, easier travel, and military conquests, in tandem with technological and scientific developments, made the need for more precise maps indispensable. New techniques, such as usage of latitudes and longitudes, were introduced, as well as new measurement instruments and land surveying. The 17th century established a few centers of map publishing in Europe. Among the best and most desired were maps published by Dutch cartographers: the dynasties of Blaeu, Jansson, Hondius, de Witt and Visscher, as well as some others, such as Germany\u2019s Peter Schenk and Johann Homann. Before the technological improvements of the 19th century, such as lithographic and chemical methods in printing, the reproduction of maps in the 16th and 17th centuries was based on woodblock prints, engraving and etching. Although maps became more common, they were still quite expensive and only the rich could afford to buy them; however, publishers usually printed several versions of maps and atlases with varying degrees of coloring. Naturally, those with the most coloring and decoration were the most expensive. The owners could and did color some of the maps, though not necessarily at the time of publication. It is difficult without the help of an expert to distinguish when coloring was applied to a particular map. The maps in this collection are superb examples of 17th and 18th century mapmaking in Europe. Most of them used to be parts of atlases, but probably for commercial reasons were separated and sold individually to collectors. Housed in Enoch Pratt Free Library\u2019s Special Collections Department, they can now enjoyed by viewers in a digital format.","id":"4ebd6bfc3eae59000600048b","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82463","name":"Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century European Maps - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:52:07Z","url":"http://www.prattlibrary.org/research/digitalcollections.aspx?id=40806","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:13Z","id":"4ebddd41aede6400060008aa","profile_id":"4ebd6bfc3eae59000600048b","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:43:13Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:32:28Z","description":"This collection of still images is related to the American Indians of Arizona and the Southwest (1865-1970).

Hall was a forward-thinking woman, a woman of vision and daring living during an era when most women didn't dare have any vision at all. Born in 1870 in Kansas, she traveled on the Santa Fe Trail at the age of eleven to the Arizona Territory with her family in 1882, settling near modern-day Prescott Valley. Though for the most part an autodidact, Sharlot was highly literate, having been encouraged to read and write from a young age by a woman she greatly admired, her mother Adeline. Determined to become a poet, she entered several writing contests and was published. When a bill was introduced to Congress to enter the Arizona and New Mexico territories as one state, Sharlot wrote an epic poem entitled \"Arizona\" in opposition to it, eloquently describing why Arizona deserved separate statehood. The bill was defeated, conceivably due to Sharlot's efforts. During her lifetime, Sharlot published over five hundred articles, stories and poems. She also authored ten books. She is most lauded for her collections of poetry, \"Cactus and Pine\" and \"Poems of a Ranch Woman.\"\n\nSharlot developed an intense fascination and love for Arizona and southwest frontier life and history and sought to conserve what she understood to be its vanishing heritage and traditions. In 1909, Sharlot was appointed Arizona's territorial historian, the first woman to hold any salaried office in the territory, a post she would hold until 1912. Sharlot galvanized a movement that would preserve much of Arizona's heritage for generations to come. During her tenure, she visited prehistoric ruins, Indian Reservations, and Arizona pioneers, amassing an extensive and impressive collection of artifacts, oral histories, and documents. In July of 1911, Sharlot embarked on a ten week expedition across the wild, remote Arizona Strip north of the Grand Canyon, touring some of the most rugged parts Arizona had to offer.\n\nAs early as 1907, Sharlot Hall envisioned a museum for Arizona's collections. Twenty years later, she signed a contract which allowed her to house her extensive collections in the 1864 Governor's Mansion, the territory's first capitol in Prescott, and to operate it as a public museum. For the remainder of her life, Sharlot worked to preserve the old log building and Arizona's past. Sharlot's immense efforts stirred others to contribute to the preservation of Arizona history. Following her death in 1943, the museum was officially named after Sharlot Hall.\n\nThe images, documents, letters, newspaper clippings, and ephemera (some rare and rarely seen) were selected from a collection encompassing over eight (8) cubic feet of materials held at Sharlot Hall Museum Archives. The resources chosen document two of the many roles Sharlot played in her diversified, singular life; those of historian and museum curator. They also reflect upon her personal life, illuminating Sharlot as a woman, a daughter, a sister, a friend, a writer, an activist, and a politician.","id":"4ebd6a3f3eae59000600023f","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81509","name":"Sharlot M.

Village officials resisted Collin's efforts to demonstrate in Skokie, first by passing a series of ordinances aimed at preventing distribution of hate materials, parading in military costumes, and then obliging parade organizers to obtain an insurance bond before a permit would be issued. The ordinances were ultimately overturned following a series of state and federal lawsuits and the neo-Nazis were eventually issued a permit to demonstrate in Skokie. However, instead of facing the growing number of organized counter-demonstrators, Collin and his group held rallies in Federal Plaza in downtown Chicago and in Marquette Park in south Chicago. Collin's decision to target Skokie was particularly poignant because Skokie was home to a large population of Jewish people and many survivors of the Holocaust. Village officials, citizens of Skokie, and people from all over the United States offered advice on the best way to thwart the impact that a neo-Nazi demonstration would have on the community.

Handwritten or printed, the words recorded on fragile papers capture the poignancy of the moment and provide powerful reminders of those trapped in slavery and of others who dared to escape its bonds.","id":"4ebd6a8b3eae5900060002c2","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81683","name":"Slave Documents Collection - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:45:54Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=5110","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z","id":"4ebddc9eaede64000600055c","profile_id":"4ebd6a8b3eae5900060002c2","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:23Z","description":"Slaves and the Courts, 1740-1860 contains just over a hundred pamphlets and books (published between 1772 and 1889) concerning the difficult and troubling experiences of African and African-American slaves in the American colonies and the United States. The documents, most from the Law Library and the Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the Library of Congress, comprise an assortment of trials and cases, reports, arguments, accounts, examinations of cases and decisions, proceedings, journals, a letter, and other works of historical importance. Of the cases presented here, most took place in America and a few in Great Britain. Among the voices heard are those of some of the defendants and plaintiffs themselves as well as those of abolitionists, presidents, politicians, slave owners, fugitive and free territory slaves, lawyers and judges, and justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. Significant names include John Quincy Adams, Roger B. Taney, John C. Calhoun, Salmon P. Chase, Dred Scott, William H. Seward, Prudence Crandall, Theodore Parker, Jonathan Walker, Daniel Drayton, Castner Hanway, Francis Scott Key, William L. Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Denmark Vesey, and John Brown.

Many of the writer's - all are men - talk of their families, education, occupations before and after arriving out West, as well as experiences mining, businesses, farming and ranching. Other aspects of their new lives are discussed: law and politics, the military and wars, social events, agriculture, literature and theater, shipping and leisure activities.

The geographic location discussed range from all over the United States: New England, New York, the south, the Midwest - especially Missouri - and of course locations along both the overland trails to the West, as well as ports of call in South and Central America.

The collection reproduces 35 of the guides, which were published by the Spalding Athletic Company in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Spalding\u2019s Official Base Ball Guide was perhaps the premier publication of its day for the game of baseball. It featured editorials from baseball writers on the state of the game, statistics, photographs, and analysis of the previous season for all the Major League teams and for many of the so-called minor leagues across the nation. The 15 Spalding\u2019s Official Base Ball Guides included in this online collection were published between 1889 and 1939. The Official Indoor Baseball Guide concerns a game unfamiliar to most contemporary baseball fans because its demise occurred almost beyond living memory. These guides, too, offer rules and \u201chow-to\u2019s\u201d of the game, information on the game\u2019s founding fathers, photographic illustrations of teams and players from across the land, and game statistics.

The supporting documents include petitions or memorials to a governor for land; surveys or plats; attests; deeds of sale, gifts, wills, bequests, and exchanges; applications; and translations of Spanish documents.\n\nThe Spanish Land Grants were land claims filed by settlers in Florida after the transfer of the territory from Spain to the United States in 1821 in order to prove land ownership. Starting in 1790, Spain offered land grants to encourage settlement to the sparsely populated and vulnerable Florida colony. When the United States assumed control of Florida, it agreed to honor any valid land grants. Yet residents had to prove that validity through documentation and testimonials. Therefore, these records were the dossiers filed by grantees to the U.S. government. They were either confirmed (found to be valid) or unconfirmed (found invalid) by the US government through land commissions, federal courts, or by the U.S. Congress.

The names of these celebrated Marylanders are well known for their contribution to athletics.  Maryland and its inhabitants have for centuries played a significant role in the development and promotion of sports.  Professional, amateur and collegiate halls of fame list the accomplishments of our native sons and daughters.\n\nAnd, it is not only the players, but the sport as well.  Long known as the hot bed of lacrosse, the state team sport, most collegiate lacrosse rosters list Maryland players.  The Preakness at Pimlico is the second jewel in horse racing's triple crown, and has been run since 1873.  It was Alan Ameche's overtime touchdown plunge that gave the Baltimore Colts the National Football League title over the New York Giants and began what most recognize as the modern era of professional football.  Is there a more storied collegiate football game than Army-Navy?  Maryland boasts a long record in baseball history as well.  It was 1902 when John McGraw, manager of the Baltimore Orioles left the team to join the New York Giants and soon ownership of the Orioles franchise was transferred to the National League Giants. The following year the team was reincarnated as the New York Highlanders of the American League.  It was only a few years later that the team recently known as the Orioles became better known as - the New York Yankees!  And let us not forget that McGraw, along with his fellow player and saloon partner Wilbert Robinson, take credit for inventing the sport of duckpin bowling in the late 1890's.\n\nFrom figure skating and jousting, amateur and pro, Marylanders can be proud of their involvement in athletics.  The material represented in this exhibit underscores this heritage and will educate and entertain.  So, when you speak of the relationship of Marylanders to sport, remember the greats from our state go way beyond Babe Ruth and Cal Ripken, Jr.\n\nCollection overview written by Jeff Korman, Maryland Department Manager.","id":"4ebd6a8b3eae5900060002c3","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81684","name":"Sports in Maryland - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=320","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z","id":"4ebddc9eaede64000600055e","profile_id":"4ebd6a8b3eae5900060002c3","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:30Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:27Z","description":"John Springer (1850 -- 1937), an Iowa City printer, bequeathed his collection of printing ephemera, letters and books to the University of Iowa at his death in 1937.

Architect Emile Weil of New Orleans constructed the exquisitely designed combination Vaudeville theatre and movie house. It prospered under the management of the Saenger-Ehrlich Enterprise until 1929, when it was acquired by Paramount Pictures, who operated the theatre until the early 1970s. Volunteers helped preserve the Strand until 1977, when the Strand Theatre Corporation (a non-profit group) purchased and restored it to its original splendor.\n\nAs a result of its unique position as one of few surviving theaters from the \"Movie Palace Era,\" the Strand was named the Official State Theatre of Louisiana in 1980. Today, touring Broadway productions, dance performances, Shreveport Symphony concerts, and special attractions at the Strand provide a link to the theatre district of Shreveport's past.\n\nThe Strand Theatre Collection contains photographs from the Strand Theater Collection located in the Louisiana State University at Shreveport, Noel Memorial Library, Archives and Special Collections.

Some came to conduct archaeological expeditions or tour religious sites, while others hoped to investigate ancient cultures or pursue geopolitical interests. These travelers documented their visits through narratives and images, and today these documents provide invaluable resources for students and scholars in a variety of disciplines, ranging from literature and women's studies, to archaeology, religion, history, and postcolonial studies.\n\nUntil now, these materials have been scattered throughout libraries and private collections around the world, and systematic research on these documents has been time-consuming and expensive. However, TIMEA, the Travelers in the Middle East Archive, provides greater access to many of these rare materials as well as sophisticated analytical tools, thereby enabling new modes of scholarship focused on these textual, visual, and geographical resources.\n\nThe Travelers in the Middle East Archive (TIMEA) offers digitized travel narratives, photographic and hand-drawn images of the subject areas, and interactive GIS maps. In addition, TIMEA provides teaching and research modules that set the materials in context and guide users through the process of conducting research.\n\nThe initial phase of the project focuses on resources related to Egypt, but the development of the archive is ongoing.

Gutman Collection and 6 maps from its Starin Collection. This selection of Maryland maps, which covers its Proprietary, Early Colonial, and Post-Colonial periods from the years 1631 to 1878, includes a map of Maryland before it received its name and a rare map of a proposed Chesapeake and Delaware Canal via the Sassafras River that was never built.\n\nThe Gutman Collection was donated by Arthur J. Gutman, a native Baltimorean who was born in 1911 and graduated Baltimore City College High School in 1928. His donation in 1999 helped the Talbot County Free Library attain the most complete Maryland map collection on the Eastern Shore.\n\nThe Starin Collection consists of maps of Maryland, especially of the Eastern Shore, and is named for Mary E. Starin, who in the 1960s was curator of the Maryland Room and first cataloguer of its collections of books and papers. In 1968 she oversaw and contributed to the publication of a book about the collections entitled Guardian of Our Maryland Heritage: The Maryland Room, Talbot County Free Library.\n\nThese maps show Maryland from its earliest founding to its 19th century boundaries.

This catalogue includes all lithographs (monotypes are not included) made at Tamarind Institute between 1970 and 2002. We intend to add new prints as they are made and, eventually, to include all lithographs made at Tamarind Lithography Workshop between 1960 and 1970 as well; a softbound, printed catalogue raisonne of the TLW prints, with thumbnail images in black and white, is available for purchase from Tamarind Institute.\n\nThe online catalogue has been compiled from complete documentation records, signed by both the artist and the printer, maintained at Tamarind Institute. The practice of recording all pertinent details of each edition was initiated by Clinton Adams when he was Associate Director of Tamarind Lithography Workshop in 1960, and has been adopted by many contemporary printmaking workshops. Tamarind's documentation records include detailed information regarding the project dates as well as specifics related to drawing methods and materials, printing processes and techniques, and the proofs. Tamarind normally does not pull a cancellation proof, but our documentation record states that all plates have been destroyed.\n\nWe have included thumbnail images when available. Many images from the 1970s must be re-photographed and will be added to this catalogue as time and resources allow. The Tamarind archive is held by the University of New Mexico Art Museum. Their accession numbers will also be added eventually. For inquiries regarding access to the Tamarind archive collection or exhibition loans, please contact Curator of Prints and Photographs, Michele M. Penhall, directly at (505) 277-4001.

In addition to memoirs and other first-person accounts, these texts include newspaper stories, local publications, and manuscripts.

The online collection includes extensive interviews on native forest species and the seasonal round of traditional harvesting (including spring greens; summer berries and fish; and fall nuts, roots such as ginseng, fruits, and game) and documents community cultural events such as storytelling, baptisms in the river, cemetery customs, and the spring \"ramp\" feasts using the wild leek native to the region. Interpretive texts outline the social, historical, economic, environmental, and cultural contexts of community life, while a series of maps and a diagram depicting the seasonal round of community activities provide special access to collection materials.","id":"4ebd6b9f3eae5900060003f5","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82186","name":"Tending the Commons: Folklife and Landscape in Southern West Virginia","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:04Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/tending/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:49Z","id":"4ebddcedaede64000600079b","profile_id":"4ebd6b9f3eae5900060003f5","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:49Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:25:45Z","description":"The \"Tennessee Documentary History, 1796-1850,\" contains 2,000 documents and images relating to the history of antebellum Tennessee.","id":"4ebd68a93eae590006000040","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2520","name":"Tennessee Documentary History, 1796-1850","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:43:44Z","url":"http://diglib.lib.utk.edu/dlc/tdh/index.html","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:21Z","id":"4ebddaf1aede640006000069","profile_id":"4ebd68a93eae590006000040","text":"User-agent: *\nAllow: /\n\nsitemap http://dlc.lib.utk.edu/sitemap.txt\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:21Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Science","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:31:46Z","description":"This collection is comprised of 100 photographic prints documenting 6 field seasons during the years 1935-1941 when James T. Tanner and associates studied the ivory-billed woodpecker and its environment on the Singer Tract, Madison Parish, Louisiana, in what is now the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge. Also included is Tanner's hand-drawn, two-sided map documenting nesting sites and other signs of the ivory-billed woodpecker's presence in the Singer and Ayer Tracts, Madison Parish.\n\nIn 1935, a team of Cornell scientists - including Arthur A. Allen, Peter Paul Kellogg, George Miksch Sutton, J.J. Kuhn, and James T. Tanner - located three ivory-billed woodpecker nests in the Singer Tract. The researchers spent several days closely monitoring one of the nests and produced the first motion pictures and sound recordings ever obtained of the species. From 1937 to 1941, James Tanner (1914-1991) spent a large portion of his time living in the Singer Tract, collecting information about the ivory-billed woodpecker. Tanner used the data for his Cornell doctoral dissertation, which the Audubon Society later published in the Research report of the National Audubon Society, number 1, 1942. In 1941, Tanner and his wife, Nancy Burnham Sheedy Tanner, saw several ivory-billed woodpeckers at the Singer Tract. That same year, the National Audubon Society launched a campaign to preserve the Singer Tract as a refuge for ivory-billed woodpeckers. Tanner taught at East Tennessee State University from 1940, before serving in the Navy during World War II, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. From 1947 until retirement in 1979, he was at the University of Tennessee. Tanner did not return to the area until the 1980s, when the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge officially opened.","id":"4ebd6a123eae5900060001ec","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81417","name":"Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge Ivory Billed Woodpecker Records","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:17Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_Tensas.php?CISOROOT=/Tensas","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:38Z","id":"4ebddc2eaede6400060003b9","profile_id":"4ebd6a123eae5900060001ec","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:38Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:58Z","description":"Texas Heritage Online provides unified online access to Texas' historical documents and images for use by teachers, students, historians, genealogists, and other researchers.","id":"4ebd68f23eae590006000084","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2706","name":"Texas Heritage Online","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:43:59Z","url":"http://www.thdi.org","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:10Z","id":"4ebddb22aede6400060000e5","profile_id":"4ebd68f23eae590006000084","text":"# robots.txt to block all bots except bots from Google , MSN , Yahoo\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /fcmedianet.js\nDisallow: /__media__/js/templates.js\nDisallow: /cmedianet\nDisallow: /cmdynet\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow:\nUser-agent: Slurp\nDisallow:\nUser-agent: MSNBot\nDisallow:\nUser-agent: ia_archiver\nDisallow:\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:34:10Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:40Z","description":"Exhibition catalogs from the Art Institute of Chicago.","id":"4ebd6bb03eae59000600042c","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82351","name":"The Art Institute of Chicago Exhibition Catalog","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:19Z","url":"http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/landingpage/collection/artic","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:17Z","id":"4ebddd09aede6400060007ec","profile_id":"4ebd6bb03eae59000600042c","text":"User-agent: *\r\nAllow: /\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:42:17Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:54Z","description":"The Gutman Collection was donated by Arthur J.

Over the five year period, the staff sought out newspapers from every nook and cranny in New Mexico. One thousand six hundred unique newspaper titles that were published in New Mexico since 1844 were identified, cataloged, and holdings inventoried during the first phase. Efforts were made to identify Spanish language newspapers as well as bilingual newspapers in Spanish and English. In the second phase, the microfilming of selected newspapers was carried out. Priority was given to newspapers never before microfilmed and every effort was made to ensure state wide coverage -- especially newspapers in smaller locales. Over 600 reels (almost 500,000 pages of newsprint) were filmed. Contributing institutions received positive copies of the microfilm and the original issues were returned if the lending institutions desired. UNM Libraries Center for Southwest Research maintains the master negatives. Positive copies of the microfilm completed during the project are available in the microfilm collection.\nThe database resulting from the project research is available via this web site. At present, it contains only information about holdings. The information that is found in this database includes title, place of publication (city and county), publisher, dates that the newspaper was published, language, frequency of publication, and holdings locations for the various institutions. No one institution holds every newspaper, but this database will assist researchers in locating where the holdings may be found. Eventually, digital copies of some newspapers will be added to this web site.\nThis project was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the University of New Mexico Center for Regional Studies and the Friends of the University of New Mexico Libraries. \n","id":"4ebd6a583eae590006000269","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81570","name":"The New Mexico Newspaper Project","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:40Z","url":"http://econtent.unm.edu/cdm4/index_NewMexicoNewspapers.php","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:58Z","id":"4ebddc7eaede6400060004ac","profile_id":"4ebd6a583eae590006000269","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:58Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Language Arts"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:39:20Z","description":"The Melrose Park Public Library digitized copies of our local newspaper, The Herald, from the WWII years of 1941-1945.

Lieutenant W.E. Johnson to his wife, father and other persons. Lt. Johnson and his wife appear to have been residents of Liberty Hill, Kershaw County, South Carolina. At the time of his writing these letters, Johnson and Ann, his wife, had two sons. All of the letters date from 1864 -- Johnson was in his late 30's when he wrote them. He was a private, then an officer in a South Carolina unit (Co. K, 7th SC Cavalry Regiment) and was captured in combat on May 30, 1864 at Cold Harbor, Virginia. He remained a prisoner-of-war until the end of the conflict (i.e., spring of 1865). As a prisoner-of-war, Johnson had the unfortunate honor of being a member of the group that has come to be known as the \"Immortal Six Hundred,\" a group of about 600 captured Confederate officers. The Six Hundred were, by order of U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, transferred to and held in a prison camp on Morris Island exposed to Confederate artillery fire (due to the camp's proximity to Federal batteries). The camp on Morris Island was subject to shelling by Confederate occupied Fort Sumter (directly to the north of the island, in the harbor's mouth). The deliberate placement of the Confederate prisoners-of-war in harm's way was an act of retaliation by the Federal administration, who viewed the placement of Federal POWs in Charleston (ostensibly unduly exposed to Federal fire) as highly improper.","id":"4ebd6b6d3eae590006000348","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81927","name":"The W.E.

The primary mediums in which she worked were: ceramic, performance, artist's books, concrete poetry, film, video, sculpture, mail art, audio, and slide projections. In many cases her work combined aspects of different media, blurring the boundaries between conventionally distinct categories. It was characteristic of Cha to take the thematic and formal approaches developed in one medium and reinterpret them in another; elements of film and video, for example, find their way into artist's books and vice versa.\n\nThe central theme of Cha's art is displacement. While she occasionally addressed the personal and historical circumstances of her exile directly, Cha typically treated this theme symbolically, representing displacement through shifts and ruptures in the visual and linguistic forms of her works. She developed an approach to displacement based largely on cinematic forms and the psychoanalytic aspects of French film theory. Cha integrated elements of these theories into her own exploration of the processes of memory, communication, and psychic transformation.","id":"4ebd68b63eae590006000050","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?2540","name":"Theresa Hak Kyung Cha Collection 1971-1991","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:47:49Z","url":"http://findaid.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf238n986k","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:33Z","id":"4ebddafdaede640006000089","profile_id":"4ebd68b63eae590006000050","text":"User-Agent: *\nAllow: /\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:33:33Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:49Z","description":"Thomas Johnson (1732-1819), Maryland's first elected Governor, held a variety of positions throughout his life both in the political arena as well as in the private sector.

Also on exhibition are more than 20 hand-tinted photographs by Dr. Gandy, on loan from Joan Gandy of Natchez. The photographs, drawn from a recent acquisition of the Dr. Thomas H. and Joan Gandy Photograph Collection by the LSU Libraries Special Collections division, will provide answers to such questions as: What did Natchez-Under-the-Hill look like in the late 1800s? How did people dress to have their pictures taken? What tools did photographers use? How had those things changed by the 1940s? Brothers Henry and M. J. Gurney established a daguerreotype studio in Natchez in 1851 and began recording the lives of their fellow citizens using the latest in photographic technology. The Civil War brought economic disaster and social upheaval to the region, but Natchez quickly recovered. In 1870, Henry Gurney hired a new employee, Henry Norman, and by 1876 Norman had opened his own studio, buying out Gurney's studio to do so. Henry Norman became the best-known photographer in the region. When he died in 1913, his son Earl inherited the studio. Earl, like his father, became widely known for his photographic skills and left images spanning nearly 40 years.","id":"4ebd6a123eae5900060001ed","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81418","name":"Thomas and Joan Gandy Photographs","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:17Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_LSU_TJP.php?CISOROOT=/LSU_TJP","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:39Z","id":"4ebddc2faede6400060003bb","profile_id":"4ebd6a123eae5900060001ed","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:39Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:33:53Z","description":"The following veterans were interviewed and/or researched by 10th-grade students in Mike Gilbert's 20th Century Global Studies classes at Fremont Ross High School, Fremont, Ohio.

He drilled his first well in East Texas, and for the next fifty years, Tom Bell worked in the oil fields, drilling over a hundred wells in Louisiana and Texas, earning a reputation as one of the most prolific wildcatters in the region.

By the time posts were dotting the landscape in northern Arizona, laws had changed several times, but traders were still required to register in those early years.\n\nThe landscape changed somewhat from post to post but constant was the isolation surrounding each site. It required stalwart pioneers to undertake a business such as this, moving their families into harsh environments. Yet a look at these photographs belies the severity of daily life. You will see a range of emotions on faces that could have well been in more civilized locales.\n\nIn all a dozen or so Winslow families helped settle this part of the American Frontier, the total of their holdings reaching nearly 30 outposts. The value of these enterprises to the Native Americans and the traders has long been established. What we attempt to share here are peeks into the lives of these pioneer families who carved out an existence and made history along the way. The early traders have passed, but most have three generations that have remained in Winslow, or maintained strong ties to their heritage here.","id":"4ebd6a413eae590006000243","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81513","name":"Trading Post Families of Winslow, AZ","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:32Z","url":"http://azmemory.lib.az.us/cdm4/index.php?CISOROOT=/otmtrade","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:32Z","id":"4ebddc64aede640006000465","profile_id":"4ebd6a413eae590006000243","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:39:32Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:29:44Z","description":"Trails of Hope: Overland Diaries and Letters, 1846-1869 is a collection of the original writings of 49 voyagers on the Mormon, California, Oregon, and Montana trails who wrote while traveling on the trail.

Often these are the only extant copies, not only of appellate arguments and decisions, but also of records that originated with lower courts, for many lower-court copies have been lost to fire, theft, and age-related deterioration.\n\nCase files include a small number of legal documents, dating between 1769 and 1812, which were used as exhibits or in transcripts, and dockets for some cases which were \"unreported\", meaning that the opinion was not published in Louisiana Reports. Supplementing these case files are docket books, which serve as a sort of index to the case files, and minute books, which summarize particular cases and record the Court's disposition of them.\n\nIn addition to the winter and spring sessions held in New Orleans, until 1894 the Supreme Court met elsewhere in the state during the summer and fall, at times in Opelousas, Alexandria, Baton Rouge, Monroe, Natchitoches, and Shreveport. Each location maintained its own docket-numbering system. Several times, coinciding with new state constitutions, one numbering system was discontinued and another was begun. Many case files, docket books, and minute books for Court sessions held outside New Orleans are missing. Since 1898 the Court has held its sessions only in New Orleans.","id":"4ebd6a153eae5900060001f0","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81421","name":"University of New Orleans Historical Archives of the Supreme Court of Louisiana","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:18Z","url":"http://louisdl.louislibraries.org/cdm4/index_UNO_SCC.php?CISOROOT=%2FUNO_SCC","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:42Z","id":"4ebddc32aede6400060003c1","profile_id":"4ebd6a153eae5900060001f0","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:38:42Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:31:44Z","description":"The Survey Research Center at the University of New Orleans (the \"UNO Poll\") exists to serve the research, teaching and service needs of the University and of the larger community.

Oscar Grossheim lived and worked in Muscatine all his life. His career spanned the early development of the art of photography. Beginning in 1877, as a boy of fifteen, Grossheim was apprenticed to a local photographer where he learned to make tintypes. Along with his older brother, Alexander, the Grossheims opened their own studio in 1886, using the newest technology: plates of glass, instead of tin, with photographic emulsion on one side. After six years, Alexander left the partnership and Oscar continued with his own studio until his retirement in 1954. Of special interest in the collection are the photographs of store window displays, the pearl button industry, and local life of the time along the river.

Livestock is assumed to include all types of animals raised for pleasure or for profit. The 1917 law was the first to specifically mention cattle, horses, and mules as livestock [ Laws of Utah, chapter 105 (1917)], although the brands of these and perhaps other animals may have been recorded before then. Subsequent revisions of the brand law expanded the definition of livestock to include several other animals.\n\nThe first surviving book in the series is an 1874 cumulation that records all brands that had been issued in the territory since 1849. A second cumulative brand book was published in 1884 covering the previous ten years, followed by several supplements. The practice of regularly rerecording brands every ten years started in 1901. The pattern was to publish a cumulative issue with supplementary books published more frequently that would include all new brands registered since publication of the last cumulative issue. Brands and marks not renewed were dropped from the brand book and could be reassigned.\n\nRegular cumulative issues start with the 1901 edition, but some issues are not included in Archives holdings. Beginning in 1976, cumulative issues start appearing at five year intervals. Many annual supplements are also missing from the series as well; and it is possible either that both the supplements and cumulative issues were never published, or that copies were simply not found in the series when it was processed. Laws required publication of supplements only \"as often as was deemed necessary\".\n\nEntries in the brand books include the brand symbol, name of the person registering the mark or brand, the location on the body of the animal, county of residence of the applicant, and the date the brand was recorded. Graphic illustrations of where the marks and brands appeared on the body were added to the books with the 1901 volume. Brand registry numbers were added beginning in 1922.","id":"4ebd69873eae59000600016e","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81160","name":"Utah Division of Animal Industry's Brand Books, 1849-1930","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:48:55Z","url":"http://archives.utah.gov/digital/540.htm","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:28Z","id":"4ebddbacaede6400060002cd","profile_id":"4ebd69873eae59000600016e","text":"User-agent: *\r\nDisallow: /_mm/\r\nDisallow: /_notes/\r\nDisallow: /_baks/\r\nDisallow: /MMWIP/\r\n\r\nUser-agent: googlebot\r\nDisallow: *.csi\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:36:28Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:29:25Z","description":"This collection contains news clippings collected by the Governor's office from various sources.

The series contains the working copies of House bills, claims (through 1915), petitions (until 1921), memorials, reports (1897 only) and resolutions. The working copy includes the bill as introduced and any amendments made to it. The final official version of the bill is not part of this series unless it was vetoed by the Governor, returned to the Legislature while still in session, and the Legislature failed to override the veto.\n\nBill, in the broad sense, refers to bills, resolutions, memorials, etc. In the narrow sense, bills consist of those documents which a member of the Legislature desires to have made into a Utah law. A bill normally consists of at least its designated number, a title, an enacting clause, and the main text. Sponsor name(s) appear on the face of the bill. House bills are introduced on the floor of the House and go through three readings before passage. In the process they are referred to one or more committees. The committee reports back with the recommendation that the bill be passed, amended, or rejected. A bill may also be amended on the floor at certain stages. If the bill passes the House after a third reading, it goes to the Senate where it goes through a similar procedure before returning to the House for acceptance of any amendments and is sent to the Governor. All these actions, with the dates taken, are logged on the back of the bill. From the turn of the century through 1994, the backing sheets on the bills were blue, leading to the nickname \"blue backs.\" By the 1995 session, larger blue backing sheets were no longer used, but the actions were simply logged on the last sheet of paper.","id":"4ebd69863eae59000600016d","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81159","name":"Utah Legislature.

The individuals documented in this presentation have much to say about living as African Americans from the 1870s to the 1930s, and beyond.","id":"4ebd6ba03eae5900060003f9","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82192","name":"Voices from the Days of Slavery: Former Slaves Tell Their Stories","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:04Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/voices/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:49Z","id":"4ebddcedaede6400060007a3","profile_id":"4ebd6ba03eae5900060003f9","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:49Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:38:24Z","description":"Voices from the Dust Bowl: The Charles L.

W9XK, the University of Iowa's experimental television station, went on the air January 25, 1933, with a weekly or twice-weekly schedule of lectures, music, and drama. It was the first educational TV station in the U.S. W9XK aired programs regularly, attracting a small but loyal audience. Viewers from as far away as Pennsylvania reported receiving the signal.\n\nE.B. Kurtz, head of the UI's Department of Electrical Engineering, Carl Menzer, manager of WSUI radio, and Clement F. Wade, a 1913 UI College of Law graduate and president of the Chicago-based Western Television Corporation, launched the project. Telecasts originated from the electrical engineering building two blocks east of Old Capitol. Programs included lectures on such varied topics as oral hygiene, identifying trees, and charcoal sketching.\n\nThe video portion of the broadcasts was delivered via short-wave frequency 2050 kHz, while sound was provided by WSUI at 880 kHz on AM. The W9XK experiment ended in 1939, when the station's mechanical-disk system of transmission became obsolete, succeeded by an electronic system largely in use today. Another experimental station, W9XUI, operated briefly as a closed-circuit (non-broadcast) service during 1940-41.\n\nThis collection, featuring over 100 items, includes photographs, correspondence, and articles chronicling W9XK's brief but significant history. Materials are from the University of Iowa Archives, Department of Special Collections. No video or film footage of W9XK's broadcasts is known to exist today.","id":"4ebd6a783eae5900060002a8","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81657","name":"W9XK Experimental Television at Iowa","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:50Z","url":"http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/w9xk/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:28Z","id":"4ebddc9caede640006000528","profile_id":"4ebd6a783eae5900060002a8","text":"# Disallowing all robots - BT 3/31/10\r\n# added atomz - LR 11/2010\r\n\r\nUser-agent: Atomz/1.0\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: Googlebot\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/\r\n\r\nUser-agent: bingbot\r\nDisallow: /dmscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/admin/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/client/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/cqr/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/images/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/includes/\r\nDisallow: /cdm4/jscripts/\r\nDisallow: /cdm-diagnostics/\r\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\r\nDisallow: /images/\r\nDisallow: /u/\r\n\r\n\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow: / \r\n\r\nsitemap: http://digital.lib.uiowa.edu/sitemapindex.xml\r\n\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:28Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":["Arts","Language Arts","Science","Social Studies"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:26:48Z","description":"Open Vault provides online access to unique and historically important content produced by public television station WGBH for individual and classroom learning.

The letters were written primarily in the early 1940s, shortly after Guthrie had moved to New York City and met the Archive's assistant in charge, Alan Lomax. In New York Guthrie pursued broadcasting and recording careers, meeting a cadre of artists and social activists and gaining a reputation as a talented and influential songwriter and performer. His written and, occasionally, illustrated reflections on his past, his art, his life in New York City, and the looming Second World War provide unique insight into the artist best-known for his role as \"Dust Bowl balladeer.\" The online presentation contains fifty-three items (eighty-four pages) of manuscript material by, about, and to Woody Guthrie, from 1940 to 1950. It is selected from material in the Woody Guthrie Manuscript Collection and the American Folklife Center's correspondence files.

The four-month study of occupational culture in Paterson, New Jersey, was conducted in 1994. Paterson is considered to be the cradle of the Industrial Revolution in America. It was founded in 1791 by the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.), a group that had U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton as an advocate. The basis for Paterson's manufacturing potential was the Great Falls on the Passaic River. Paterson went on to become the largest silk manufacturing center in the nation as well as a leader in the manufacture of many other products, from railroad locomotives to firearms. The documentary materials presented in this online collection explore how this industrial heritage expresses itself in Paterson today: in its work sites, work processes, and memories of workers. The online presentation also includes interpretive essays exploring such topics as work in the African-American community, a distinctive food tradition (the Hot Texas Wiener), the ethnography of a single work place (Watson Machine International), business life along a single street in Paterson (21st Avenue), and narratives told by retired workers.","id":"4ebd6ba13eae590006000404","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?82203","name":"Working in Paterson: Occupational Heritage in an Urban Setting","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:51:05Z","url":"http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/paterson/","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:57Z","id":"4ebddcf5aede6400060007b9","profile_id":"4ebd6ba13eae590006000404","text":"User-agent: Ultraseek\nUser-agent: heritrix\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: *\nDisallow: /cgi-bin/\nDisallow: /ammem/wpa/\nDisallow: /ammem/0\nDisallow: /ammem/1\nDisallow: /phpdata/\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /ammem/techdocs/digform/\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\n\nUser-agent: Googlebot\nDisallow: /cgi-bin\nDisallow: /pnp/temp3\nDisallow: /natlib\nAllow: /ll/amrvl\nAllow: /ll/llac\nAllow: /ll/llcc\nAllow: /ll/llcg\nAllow: /ll/llcr\nAllow: /ll/lldc\nAllow: /ll/lldg\nAllow: /ll/llec\nAllow: /ll/lled\nAllow: /ll/llej\nAllow: /ll/llfr\nAllow: /ll/llhb\nAllow: /ll/llhj\nAllow: /ll/lljc\nAllow: /ll/llmisc\nAllow: /ll/llmj\nAllow: /ll/llnc\nAllow: /ll/llnt\nAllow: /ll/llrd\nAllow: /ll/llsb\nAllow: /ll/llsc\nAllow: /ll/llsj\nAllow: /ll/llsl\nAllow: /ll/llsp\nAllow: /ll/llsr\nAllow: /ll/llss\nAllow: /ll/llst\nAllow: /ll/lltr\nAllow: /ll/llts\nAllow: /ll/lltw\nAllow: /ll/pdf\nDisallow: /ll\nAllow: /cgi-bin/query/h?\nCrawl-Delay: 2\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:41:57Z"}}},{"achievement_count":0,"categories":["Social Studies","Vocational Education"],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:24:55Z","description":"Worklore: Brooklyn Workers Speak, a joint research/exhibition project of The Brooklyn Historical Society and the Brooklyn Public Library, explores the work lives of Brooklynites as they made, and continue to make, their living in the borough.

The WPA was part of Roosevelt's New Deal, a set of U.S. government programs, laws, and reforms implemented in response to the economic crisis of the 1930's. The goal of the New Deal was to promote economic recovery and to alleviate the hardships being suffered by millions of Americans during the Great Depression. The WPA lasted eight years, during which time it provided jobs for approximately 8 1/2 million people. The WPA employed workers in a wide range of activities. The program built and repaired many roads, bridges, parks, and buildings. Other infrastructure-related projects included improvements to public utilities (water, waste, electricity, etc.). The WPA created literacy and arts programs, such as the Federal Writers' Project. The program also provided occupational training, housing, and distributed food and other necessities.","id":"4ebd6a8f3eae5900060002c8","imlsdcc_identifier":"http://imlsdcc.grainger.uiuc.edu/Registry/Collection/?81689","name":"Works Progress Administration of Maryland - Enoch Pratt Free Library","robotstxt_id":null,"sitemap_id":null,"updated_at":"2011-11-12T20:49:51Z","url":"http://www.mdch.org/collection.aspx?id=38486","achievements":{"robotstxt":{"_type":"Robotstxt","created_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:31Z","id":"4ebddc9faede640006000568","profile_id":"4ebd6a8f3eae5900060002c8","text":"#http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/faq.html\r\nUser-agent: *\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-agent: wget\r\nDisallow: \r\n\r\nUser-agent: linkchecker\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: W3C-checklink\r\nDisallow:\r\n\r\nUser-Agent: fusionbot\r\nDisallow:\r\nDisallow: /locations/web\r\nDisallow: *mark=*\r\nDisallow: /home/rss*\r\nDisallow: /about/press_releases_rss.aspx\r\n","updated_at":"2011-11-12T02:40:31Z"}}},{"achievement_count":1,"categories":[],"created_at":"2011-11-11T18:27:23Z","description":"This collection, from the Illinois State Library, contains monographs and pamphlets on such subjects as Illinois' participation in the war effort, the role of women, and educational challenges during what was called \"the Great War.\"\n\nHundreds of men, as well as many women, of Illinois were playing a part in the World War long before the United States entered the war.

The mythical world created by the popular writers of the period such as Bret Harte, Owen Wister, and Zane Grey, was situated in the fabled Southwest and populated by cowboys, gunslingers, prospectors, school marms, cattle rustlers and Indians (both friendly and unfriendly), all produced to satisfy readers hankering for adventure. That our rapidly industrializing nation found refuge in this arid, rugged land of make-believe is without doubt. What is less clear is the effect this fictional culture had on the actual development of the Southwest. In what ways did the storytellers and myth makers impact on the region's identify? To what degree does this mythology affect the way in which we perceive ourselves as Southwesterners?\n\nIn 1983, the Tucson Public Library, in cooperation with the Arizona Historical Society, received a $200,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to conduct a project in Southwest regional studies entitled: \"Writers of the Purple Sage: Origins of a National Myth.\" The two-fold purpose of the study was to explore the effects the myths, values, and stereotypes transmitted in the early popular literature of the region continue of have on literature and life in the Southwest, and also to provide permanent resources for librarians and other educators interested in developing public humanities programs on Southwest regional studies.\n\nThe material in the collection exists in five volumes. The first volume includes introductory and explanatory materials, and four audiocassettes of readings.
